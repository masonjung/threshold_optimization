This is for the threshold optimization project

Why We Need Threshold Optimization:

In machine learning classification tasks, setting a static threshold is a common practice to convert probabilistic outputs into categorical decisions. However, static thresholds have inherent limitations. They often fail to account for variations in data distributions across different groups or classes, leading to suboptimal performance. While the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) is frequently used to assess classifier performance, relying solely on this metric can be insufficient for ensuring fairness. For example, imposing a strict False Positive Rate (FPR) constraint like FPR < 0.1 may significantly sacrifice the True Positive Rate (TPR), resulting in a model that is both unfair and less effective.

Limitations of AUROC and FPR-Based Approaches:

OpenAI's use of AUROC and FPR-based optimization highlights the foundational limitations of these methods. By focusing primarily on controlling the FPR, their evaluation led to an inaccurate assessment of the classifier's overall performance. This approach can inadvertently prioritize certain metrics at the expense of others, such as TPR, which is crucial for capturing true positives. The reliance on FPR-based optimization may thus result in models that do not perform optimally across all necessary dimensions, particularly in terms of fairness and effectiveness.

Our Optimized Approach Using Fairness Metrics and F1 Score:

This project proposes a refined threshold optimization method that integrates fairness metrics with the F1 score to achieve a more balanced and equitable model performance. By assigning different thresholds to different groups, we aim to optimize both fairness and accuracy without disproportionately sacrificing key metrics like TPR. Although our research focuses on text data, this approach is versatile and applicable to various domains, including image, audio, video, and multimodal classification tasks that rely on probabilistic outputs. We anticipate that this technology will be valuable across multiple deployment scenarios, enhancing both the fairness and effectiveness of machine learning models in diverse applications.
