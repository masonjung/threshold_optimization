"I believe mandatory minimum laws are unjust, counterproductive to society, and lead to racial disparity. Mandatory Minimum laws (i.e. California's three strike law, Georgia's Two-Strike laws, and federal Crack Cocaine laws) take away the discretion from the jury and the judge and give it all to the prosecution. This leads to a biased system that operates on behalf of the state. Let's not stipulate in this discussion that the War on Drugs is a failed policy, but instead focus on Mandatory Minimums. I believe Mandatory Minimums are unfairly imposed onto racial minorities, and are typically for non-violent drug crimes. I believe that the mandatory sentences should be removed and sentencing should be placed back into the hands of the community (jury) and the judge. The use of these laws does nothing but flood an already stressed system with low level offenders. CMV.",1,cmv_human
"Wales coach Warren Gatland has hailed Shane Williams' late try in their defeat by Australia as a fitting end to the player's career. The 37-year-old scored his 58th international try on Saturday night at the Millennium Stadium, but it was not enough to prevent the Wallabies from triumphing 25-23. Gatland said: ""It was a fitting way for Shane to bow out of international rugby - with a try."" The former Ospreys wing, who won 87 caps for his country, made his debut in 2000 and was part of the Wales side that lifted the Grand Slam in 2008. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wingers of all time and was voted Player of the Year in 2008 by the International Rugby Board. Australian captain Nathan Sharpe paid tribute to Williams after the game, saying: ""Shane has had a fantastic career and we wish him all the best in the future."" Williams, who was given a standing ovation when he left the field, described the moment as ""incredible."" ""I'm so pleased that I got the chance to go off on a high,"" he said. Gatland added: ""It was a great opportunity to recognise Shane's contribution to Welsh rugby and celebrate an incredible career. We wish him all the best for the future.""",0,xsum_machine_specified_text-davinci-003
"So not to get hung up on technicalities, but people cite the equal protection clause of the constitution as a basis for the claim of discrimination inherent in same-sex marriage bans. (Personally I don't think the government should be involved in marriage at all). But, semantically (if that is the right word to use) marriage, defined as a legal union between a man and a woman for the purpose of shared property andor procreation, is available to people with alternate sexual preferences, just they don't want to partake in it. It being still available means they aren't being discriminated against by choosing not to marry a person of the opposite gender. Oh woah! Wait a minute! (You might say). They don't choose their orientation! - Besides the point. The union is available, but they don't meet the qualifications for it. Now, if you REDEFINE (legally) marriage before you make the argument, then you have a case for discrimination. But since people always just assume that the definition of marriage is whatever they want it to be, they then continue to make the discrimination argument. Now, I don't know if there is some law book that says what all these terms are supposed to bemean and that has been changed or if my definition is off from the current definition, or if that definition has actually changed lately, but I think I make a sound argument.

"Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between positive teacher attitudes toward their job and student success over time.[13] The Role of School Culture Schools have an important role in shaping a student's attitude towards education. According to a study done by Douglas A. Reeves ""a large proportion (80) of teachers believe that the school culture is critical for determining whether or not they will stay with teaching long term, while almost two-thirds (63) believe that school climate could make all the difference in deciding whether they continue as educators. [14 The way schools treat its employees may play a significant part in influencing a teacher's perception of herhis workplace. It has been shown elsewhere that positive school cultures tend to increase retention rates; however this does not necessarily mean schools need higher salaries or better benefits to retain current employees. There seems to be strong evidence showing that when it comes to retaining good quality teachers, a key factor isn't money but rather how valued and appreciated one feels by hisher supervisor[15]. Teachers want to work somewhere where they feel like they belong and do a job that is worthwhile. Schools should provide opportunities to develop professional growth so that students benefit from having highly committed staff members. Additionally, teachers also seek to develop relationships and connections with other people, particularly those who share similar values or beliefs. This typically occurs through informal social interactions such as lunchroom conversations, collaborative projects, etc.. Therefore, if a district wants to keep many of its employees, then it must invest in programs that allow teachers to connect with each other outside of the classroom setting; otherwise everyone involved may leave at some point in time due to dissatisfaction. Teacher Engagement With any new idea or concept there needs to be a level of commitment on behalf of both parties to ensure ongoing success. In order to achieve meaningful results in educational reform efforts, we have to get buy-in from everyone within our system including parents, the community, and most importantly, the teachers themselves. If you really want your program to succeed then you'll need to create situations that will encourage teachers to engage with their communities and students. And since teacher engagement involves much more than just teacher motivation strategies, it requires a transformation of both the structural design and practice of the current educational delivery system itself. As Lynn Pinto points out: ""It means being willing to change everythingfrom assessment practices to curriculum materials, from testing procedures to instruction."" [16] Progress will only come through effective implementation of these changes which can require resources for districts to purchase additional instructional technology tools such as interactive whiteboards, laptops, projectors, etc. Not only would increased expenditures for these items strengthen ties between school administration and teachers but grant funds could potentially be made available to cover the cost of these purchases. These types of improvements might seem daunting to organizations on tighter budgets but small steps taken every day will eventually reap great rewards down the road. Remember, the school system cannot exist without teachers! To truly improve public education across America then everyone must take responsibility for making sure teachers remain committed and excited about what they're doing.",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b
"We present a polynomial-space algorithm that computes the number of independent sets of any input graph in time O (1.1389 n) for graphs with maximum degree 3 and in time T (2.2954 k), which we call (1). The algorithm consists of two parts: a first part, where all edges are found from the vertices of the graph by means of pruning, applying an approximation algorithm to find the minimal recurrence relation between the length of adjacent edges and their vertices; this is called edge triangulation; second, a second part where the distance from each vertex of a given vertex to its nearest neighbor on its right hand side is computed as a function of the number of vertical sub-graphs contained within it, such that the shortest path from one vertex to its nearest neighbor has no more than a particular value for segments of the graphs that have been cut off at some point along the shortest path route between these two points. We show that our algorithm can be used to compute the number of independent edges from any input graph in less than 10 seconds per node, or 110th of the time required by prior algorithms.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_1.3b

"Obituary: Francisco Blake Mora The helicopter was flying to Cuernavaca in neighbouring Morelos state for a prosecutors' meeting when it went down. All eight people on board were killed. President Felipe Calderon said weather conditions were probably to blame. Mr Blake Mora, 45, was appointed to the post last year and was a key figure in the war against drug cartels. The helicopter had initially been reported missing. Some Mexican media reports said there was heavy cloud at the time. ""Unfortunately the interior secretary, his [assistants] and the helicopter crew were found dead,"" government spokeswoman Alejandra Sota said. Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro and the interior ministry's chief press officer Jose Alfredo Garcia Medina were also killed in the crash along with other government officials and the air force crew, Ms Sota said. She said a search for the helicopter began when it was discovered it had strayed from its planned course. Mexican television showed wreckage from the helicopter strewn across a hillside. Ms Sota said the craft went down in the Xochimilco area, just south of Mexico City. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Mexico Francisco Blake Mora was one of the president's right-hand men. Not only because he was in charge of domestic affairs, but also because he became one of the most strident voices of Mr Calderon's strategy against the drug cartels. In recent months, he helped co-ordinate the army, navy and federal police in the fight against drug trafficking in violence-torn cities like Veracruz or Acapulco. But his death could be a severe blow to Mr Calderon at a personal level too. Three years ago, one of the president's best friends, then Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City. That accident was one of the saddest moments for Mr Calderon since he took power in 2006, he said. Mr Camilo Mourino was remembered by members of the cabinet, including Mr Blake Mora, this week. His last message on his Twitter account (FBlakeM) was actually dedicated to Mr Mourino. ""The cloudy conditions at the time certainly make you think about the probability of an accident,"" President Calderon said in a televised address. He said a thorough investigation of the accident was being launched and cancelled a trip to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum. US President Barack Obama called Mr Calderon to offer his condolences, a US government spokesman said. Mr Obama ""reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time,"" said US National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes. The interior secretary is Mexico's senior cabinet position and the top official after the president, with responsibility for domestic affairs and security. Mr Blake was Mr Calderon's fourth interior secretary. One of his predecessors, Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City three years ago. Mr Blake began his political career in the north-western border city of Tijuana in the mid-1990s, later serving as interior secretary for Baja California state. He also served as a federal congressman from Mr Calderon's National Action Party. He earned a reputation as being a hardliner in Mexico's struggle with drug cartels. Mr Blake Mora frequently travelled to cities badly affected by the cartels, such as Veracruz and Ciudad Juarez, to help co-ordinate the government's response. More than 40,000 people are reported to have died from drug-related violence since President Calderon sent in the army to help combat the cartels in 2006.",1,xsum_human

"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn from the viewpoint of a teenage girl: I never much liked school. It was always so boring. Just sitting in a room all day, listening to some old man talk about things that didn't interest me. I much preferred being out on the river, fishing and swimming and just exploring. One day, I ran into a boy named Huck Finn. He was kind of a scruffy looking kid, but he was really nice. We became friends pretty quickly. He told me all about how he hated school too and how he ran away from home. I was fascinated. I decided that I wanted to run away too. So, I asked Huck if he would help me. He agreed and we set off down the river. It was really exciting at first. We had all sorts of adventures. But then things started to get a bit scary. We ran into some bad people and got into some dangerous situations. But Huck was always there to help me. He was my best friend and I knew I could trust him. Together, we got through everything.

"I came back into the moment before he walked through the door as I had 543 times before. It might have been 544. Keeping track is tedious, but I find it pretty important because I have little else to give my world any structure. I am still unsure as to whether I discovered this ability of mine or it discovered me, but since the first jump back, I have stopped noticeably aging. It's only been a few linear years when you look at it through the general terms of time relativity, but it must have been at least two decades of time spent in jumps. In this moment, I knew what to anticipate. The doorhandle clicks, enter Mondeau, same look of surprise on his face, the reach for the gun on his belt as his cronies enter behind him, the same expletive when the gun is mysteriously out of bullets. ""How-?"" I shrug, trying to look alive beyond the tediousness. ""Yeah, none of you have any ammunition. And Sharon, you can just shut your goddamn mouth before you open it."" Sharon looked stunned, ""I wasn't going to ""Yes, you fucking were. And it will not come out witty and evil like you think. So shut up."" I began to slowly circumnavigate the room towards the metal filing cabinet by the fake ficus. Mondeau holsters his gun, as he did each time before. I hear the ceiling creak. ""What is the plan, Groundhog? How do you plan on stopping us? We're on the brink of this now and I really can't see how ""I have heard this, Mondeau. No need to continue."" ""Well, then enlighten us."" I had reached the filing cabinet by now. ""It'd be my pleasure I quickly ripped open the bottom drawer of the cabinet as the small group of my foes scattered in reaction. Knowing exactly where each went in the room, I put my plan (543 or 544 times practiced by now) into motion. I threw the dusty mulch in to Sharon's face as a distraction then grabbed the ficus and blocked my face from the ungainly, hairy fists of the burly brute hired as Mondeau's chief security and swiped the pot underneath his feet to knock him over at just the right angle. He was down for the count when his head collided with the heavy metal drawer of the cabinet. Again, the ceiling creaked with a deeper sound. Sharon was desperately scratching at her eyes and spitting up dust and dirt as Mondeau and his two other lackeys grouped up again. I made a few strides toward them and they disbanded with some pointless sense of purpose. Dan went to Sharon and the other, an older man took the same solemn stance in front of Mondeau. Every time I had to fight back the urge to laugh. He looked like the British guard in this position and knowing what was coming next was too funny. ""Just try it, punk."" Mondeau spoke from behind his hired help. On cue, the paneled ceiling caved in and crushed Sharon and Dan under a pile of sheetrock, rubble and dust. Mondeau cried out to Sharon and the older guy was distracted enough for me to pull my own gun from my waistband and sweep behind him to grab Mondeau. With the gun against his head, I called the room back to order. ""Back the hell up and go help Sharon. She is still alive."" The man laughs, like he does every time and grabs his pistol like a blunt weapon. ""You think I care about them? You act like you know everything Another section of the ceiling falls in and crushes his leg. As he lets out an animal screech, I shrug as I make my way out of the room with Mondeau. ""You had a chance to avoid that. I warned him, didn't I?"" I walk us through the door Mondeau entered in. ""Now, I know you're thinking of a way to get away from me. I'm going to tell you now to cut that shit out. For your sake, not mine. You're going to pull the plug on this project. And there is not any'if you do not' in this scenario. Are we clear?"" His voice was thick in response, ""Yeah. Okay. You win, Groundhog."" ""Sharon is still alive, Mondeau. All of them are, not that you care. But I know you care about Sharon and she'll be okay."" I feel him slightly relax in my hold. ""If, of course, you shut this down. It will save the lives of millions of people. If you do not, your company will poison the water supply and create a war in the northern African nations. As this quickly spills into Europe and Asia and eventually into the entire world, it will be a bloodbath run by profit, the thirst for power, and the subsequent pent-up aggression built on this thirst. It is not worth the money, Mondeau. Learn from this and start listening to your research teams instead of quieting them with threats and violence."" ""I, I- Okay His words catch in his throat. He looks at his watch. ""I can stop the launch right now. I just need to call Dr. Manne."" ""Mondeau, I know you have the self-detonating cell phone. And I don't know why you plan on blowing us both up. But I don't care. Just go over to the computer and cancel the launch and delete the program files, including the backups."" ""How many times have you done this, Groundhog?"" ""None of your business. This better be the last."" Mondeau disables the program and deletes it. It takes all of two minutes with my gun pressed at the base of his skull. I flip my gun around and knock him out. As I drag him back into the room with his fallen comrades, the big burly comes barreling at me, slipping in a pile of rubble. I dash out back the way I came, barricading the door behind me (something I added into the plan just this last time around). I set the building on fire and use Mondeau's cell phone to detonate the main hard drives. Escaping out the fire exit, I call 911. Sharon will live, so, too, will Mondeau and Dan. The other two will die of smoke inhalation in the hospital. But I'll jump back and call for help just a little sooner. This is hard fucking work. But what else can I do with this ability? Go back and give unsuspecting people wedgies? That's only fun for the first few years.",1,wp_human
"We propose a new framework for education in conflict zones, considering the explosive growth of social media, web services, and mobile Internet over the past decade. Moreover, we focus on one conflict zone, Afghanistan, as a case study, because of its alarmingly high illiteracy rate, lack of qualified teachers, rough terrain, and relatively high mobile penetration of over 50. In several of Afghanistan's provinces, it is hard to currently sustain the traditional bricks-and-mortar school model, due to numerous incidents of schools, teachers, and students being attacked because of the ongoing insurgency and political instability. Our model improves the virtual school model, by addressing most of its disadvantages, to provide students in Afghanistan with an opportunity to achieve standardised education, even when the security situation does not allow them to attend traditional schools. One of the biggest advantages of this model is that it is sufficiently robust to deal with gender discrimination, imposed by culture or politics of the region.",1,sci_gen_human

"Possible newsflash: America's First DAO Approved in Wyoming In a historic move, the state of Wyoming has granted legal recognition to America's first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), signaling a new era of innovation and experimentation in digital finance and governance. The DAO, called the American CryptoFed DAO, is a non-profit entity that uses blockchain technology to create a new type of digital currency, called the DAC, that is backed by a basket of stable assets and can be used for peer-to-peer payments and other financial transactions without intermediaries. To gain approval from the Wyoming authorities, the American CryptoFed DAO had to comply with various regulatory requirements and prove its technical and operational competence, as well as its commitment to transparency and investor protection. According to the DAO's co-founder, Marian Orr, who is also the former mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, ""This is a historic day for blockchain technology and for Wyoming. We are proud to be the first DAO in America and to show the world what is possible when you combine innovation, cooperation, and regulation in a positive way."" The approval of the American CryptoFed DAO is seen as a major boost for the blockchain and crypto industry, as it opens up new avenues for fundraising, investing, and community building that could challenge traditional models of finance and governance. Some experts believe that DAOs could eventually become the dominant form of organization in many fields, from healthcare to education to entertainment, by allowing people to collaborate and coordinate their efforts in a decentralized and transparent way. However, DAOs also face many challenges and risks, such as governance disputes, technical vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainties, that need to be addressed for them to achieve their full potential. Nevertheless, the approval of America's first DAO in Wyoming is a bold step towards a more decentralized and democratic future, where individuals can have more control over their assets, their data, and their communities.",0,tldr_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

Some people who did wrong in the past now claim to have changed. Other claim they will change in the future. But ultimately I think it's all a bunch of bullshit. Just like with our bodies, our minds are created by our DNA. We are who we are, you can't change that unless you physically smash your brain with a tyre iron. Some people point to cognitive behavioural therapy and claim that we can indeed change or claim that the brain's plasticity is so impactful that you can turn a pedophile into a normal loving human being.

She told him everything she knew about her son and shouted at him not to talk anymore until after the police arrived. As he lay there bleeding, she took things very seriously and started to cry harder than before. Then the doctor called an ambulance again and the baby was taken to the hospital where he died. The woman said she couldn't believe it either. She asked her daughter if her boyfriend was okay and if he wanted to come along so she wouldn't have to worry about him being sick or dying from cancer.

"Dame Rosemary Butler said it was ""critical"" that people voted, with more powers coming to Wales. She said fewer than half of those eligible to vote did so in 2011. The Welsh government said it was ""keen to encourage as many people as possible"" to register. Ms Butler, who is presiding officer of the Welsh assembly, spoke out after a report by the Electoral Commission suggested that almost 2.5 million people in England, Scotland and Wales were not registered to vote. The commission said that while the overall picture showed positive progress on registration since the last general election in 2010, there were still some areas of concern. In Wales, the report found: 1.8 million people were registered to vote in 2011 - a drop from 1.9 million in 2010 The number of people aged 18 to 34 on the register fell from 48 to 44 Turnout for 18-24 year olds was 36, compared with 58.4 for those aged 65 and over Wales had the lowest turnout of any region or country in the UK at 53.4 Ms Butler said: ""It is critical that people exercise their hard-won right to vote, especially now that more powers are being devolved to Wales. ""In the past decade we have seen a significant increase in the number of people voting in national elections in Wales. ""However, fewer than half of those eligible to vote did so in the 2011 Welsh assembly election."" 'Reassuring trend' She added that the rate of registration had improved since 2011 and she hoped it would continue to improve following the introduction of individual voter registration in December. Ms Butler said: ""This report is reassuring evidence of a broad trend towards more people participating in democracy in Wales. ""However, it also highlights areas where we must continue to work hard to engage with young people, who remain under-registered."" A spokesperson for the Welsh government said: ""We are keen to encourage as many people as possible to register to vote, particularly young people and students. ""The 2011 census showed that the number of 16-24 year olds in Wales has fallen by 12 since 2001, meaning we need to work harder to ensure they are engaged with politics. ""That is why we have worked with the Electoral Commission to develop an online voter registration tool that can be incorporated into school websites. ""Individual voter registration will help improve the accuracy of the electoral roll and make it easier for people to register.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. Mr. Donald Trump stood at the ball, a pitiful lower-class affair, with apparent disdain. He was young, mid-thirties, but his face was furrowed and angled like someone far beyond his years. This was largely due to his current location and his feelings about it. He had no interest in dancing, nor did he share the enthusiasm that his associate Mr. Bingley was radiating outwards as he swept through the dance floor. Remember, it's just a business appearance, he told himself, meaning he didn't have to like any of these people. It's not often that donor galas were particularly exciting events, anyways, and there's always that- Mr. Trump stopped suddenly, as his attentions were drawn to a place that was suddenly the brightest spot in the room. There, a young woman took to the floor, bowed a quick curtsy, and began to dance with the others. And yet she was so positively radiant, Donald had to know more. ""That one, over there, in the blue dress..... what is her name?"" Donald asked of his associate. ""Why, that's Hillary Rodham. Born to a respectable family, but getting past the age of proper marriage..... one has to wonder why she's still single with a woman of her age."" Donald heard very little of this, his ears tuning out much that followed ""Hillary Rodham."" Trump was a man of power, and as a result he never lacked for the company of women.

"In this paper we propose a fusion approach to continuous emotion recognition that combines visual and auditory modalities in their representation spaces to predict the arousal and valence levels. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained convolution neural network and transfer learning to extract features from video frames that capture the emotional content. For the auditory content, a minimalistic set of parameters such as prosodic, excitation, vocal tract, and spectral descriptors are used as features. The fusion of these two modalities is carried out at a feature level, before training a single support vector regressor (SVR) or at a prediction level, after training one SVR for each modality. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing and post-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Experimental results for predicting spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA dataset have shown that the proposed approach takes advantage of the complementary information of visual and auditory modalities and provides CCCs of 0.749 and 0.565 for arousal and valence, respectively.",1,sci_gen_human

"Behavioural economists have shown that people are often averse to inequality and will make choices to avoid unequal outcomes. In this paper, we consider how to allocate indivisible goods fairly amongst individuals in an egalitarian manner, using a resource allocation framework with two factors of production (land and labour). The model assumes that the population is homogenous and ignorant about their individual resources; all they know is their total endowment for each factor and which other agents also hold these resources. Agents can then either choose not to work at all or accept specific jobs as part-timers under contract, thereby improving their incomes by earning extra yields on their land holdings. However, there may be no match between those willing to do housework, childcare, and farming, since some people might prefer one task over another.

"Tesla's Navigate on Autopilot is like Waze on steroids Tesla's Navigate on Autopilot is revolutionizing the way drivers get from point A to point B. The autonomous driving feature, which was first introduced in late 2018, allows Tesla drivers to put their cars on autopilot and let the vehicle do the driving for them. But what sets Navigate on Autopilot apart from other similarly designed features is its integration with Waze. The popular mapping app is known for its user-driven updates and real-time traffic information, and Navigate on Autopilot leverages these features to offer a truly comprehensive experience. By using Waze's live traffic data, Navigate on Autopilot can direct drivers on the fastest route possible, even altering the route to avoid accidents or construction. Furthermore, the system can recognize and respond to stop signs and traffic signals, making for a smoother and safer ride. In essence, Navigate on Autopilot is Waze on steroids. While the app is focused on providing accurate traffic data, Navigate on Autopilot takes it to the next level, making it the perfect choice for those who want to take a hands-off approach to driving. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has lauded the feature, calling it ""one of the most advanced autonomous driving technologies in the world."" And while the company is staving off competition from other automakers with the feature, it has also been met with some criticism. Some have expressed concern over the safety of autonomous driving technology, even as Tesla continues to emphasize that drivers need to remain alert and attentive while using Navigate on Autopilot. And while the company has promised to address these concerns, it remains to be seen how well Navigate on Autopilot will hold up in the long run. Despite these concerns, though, Navigate on Autopilot is a game-changer for many Tesla drivers. With its comprehensive approach to mapping and navigation, it sets a new standard for autonomous driving technology, promising a safer and more efficient way to get around.",0,tldr_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo

"I guess the first Note Benders started to show up around 2021. Two years before, DARPA had just announced the creation of new sound systems that were able to reach pitches and tones never before heard by the human ear - some of which we are not even capable of perceiving. Many dismissed it thinking we wouldn't ever have a need for sounds we can't even hear. But we didn't really ask many questions, and the inventors didn't explain much either, so we just let it go. Hypersonic Speakers became the new thing. People bought their fancy sound systems just as a show of status; to gloat about their new toy that nobody saw the difference in anyway. Until some very strange things started to happen. Seizures, comas, and heart attacks started spiking in numbers - all among owners of Hypersonic systems. Cases of sudden onset of mental illnesses and disabilities with no reasonable explanation, and even mass hysteria started to occur. People were terrified and nobody could explain what was happening. In the next two years, the number of unexplainable deaths that could somehow be attributed to Hypersonic players increased, but nobody really understood what was going on. The fear was grave and Hypersonic sound systems were banned from sale. Nobody was allowed to manufacture these speakers anymore. 2021 As we all know, if something is illegal, someone has it and someone else is selling it. Even with the mysterious deaths occurring due to Hyspersonics, people still wanted the systems. Some claimed they felt different when they heard certain music through those speakers. Some people claimed they could feel things surging inside of them, like a force gaining life. Much like a heavy drug, Hypersonics was something you risked your life for, but only with a chance of feeling this great rush. You were definitely more likely to die first.

"Indeed, there is preclinical proof that suggests the activation of 6-nAChRs in the mesolimbic region is associated with the emergence of a nicotine addiction trait. Research using rats as test subjects has proven that the activation of these receptors is crucial to nicotine's reinforcing effects and the emergence of behavior resembling addiction. The mesolimbic dopamine system, which is responsible for the pleasurable effects of drug use, particularly nicotine, has a significant level of 6-nAChRs expression. Stimulation of 6-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on neurons that produce dopamine can lead to an increment in the amount of dopamine that is released in the nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain that is related to motivation and pleasure. It is believed that the rise in dopamine release caused by nicotine is the reason behind the addictive qualities of the substance, eventually leading to addiction. In addition, experiments involving genetic modifications in mice have demonstrated that weakening or eliminating the function of 6-nAChRs can lessen the addictive qualities of nicotine and diminish actions related to addiction, including self-administration and relapse. To summarize, the evidence from preclinical studies suggests that the stimulation of mesolimbic 6-nAChRs is essential in maintaining the addiction to nicotine. It should be emphasized that the conclusions drawn are based on animal studies, and more investigation is required to comprehensively comprehend the involvement of these receptors in nicotine dependence of humans.",0,pubmed_gpt4_para

I try my best, but I ain't gonna have all the answers, or know the way out of the crap storm I'm in. A few years back, a couple of my friends got together and built a few AR-15s. They said they had to because they were bored with their other firearms and needed a new hobby. I told them I didn't care about guns, but they were my friends so I said, 'Sure, why not.' I had no idea it was such a big deal. The trouble is, I don't know shit about guns, so I got my buddies to show me. I've never been one to just sit back and do nothing, so I learned the AR-15. I can take one down, clean it and reassemble it, and I can do it in the dark without looking. And I can shoot the shit out of one, too. I never got to be a Boy Scout, but I made it up to Eagle.

I don't know if that makes me a bad guy, but I think it makes me a real man. I was in Iraq when I had to kill someone. It was a man, I think. I don't remember. He was trying to kill me, and I had to shoot him, so I did. And I don't feel bad about it. Not one bit. It was a kill or be killed situation. After I got back home, I couldn't settle into my old life. I was home, but I wasn't at peace with myself. The war was in my head, and I couldn't shake it.

It was a nice place, and there was a lot of good people there. They helped me out. I had to go into therapy, and I was comfortable talking about things that I didn't want to talk about at home. It was a good place for me. I left there, and I went back to my family. I saw my wife, and my kids, and my parents. I had a hard time being home, though.

"Oxygen! When the beans are roasted, amino acids and sugars start combining and reacting, creating hundreds of new compounds that make up the smell and flavor of your coffee. There's a name for the process that I can't think of off the top of my head, something like the mallard reaction. These new compounds are tasty, but delicate. Once they've been sitting in your cup getting touched all over by oxygen, they begin to oxidize. Oxidation is the process where oxygen molecules steal electrons from other molecules and they become unstable and start to decay. It's sort of like when you leave a cut apple out and it begins to brown because it's no longer protected by the outside skin.,"" ""I don't know but I just want to say I love to drink cold coffee.

I admit I have also drunk 1-2 day old coffee before and I love the taste.,"" ""Also along with d50000's explanation coffee is also very volatile and the taste changes based on exposure to oxygen.,There are several reasons. First of all, the pleasure associated with good tasting coffee is influenced by the aroma created by freshly brewed coffee, which dissipates quickly after the coffee is brewed. Also, the most common methods of brewing coffee produce coffee that contains natural oils, which degrade over time. (The Maillard reaction in coffee occurs when the coffee is roasted, not when the coffee is brewed.) ','Besides already mentioned oxidation, one specific reason that coffee left on a warming plate tastes bitter after time is because the chlorogenic acid in coffee breaks down into quinic acid, which tastes bitter. This also happens with particularly dark roasts of coffee. Source: this was asked on rCoffee a while back and I remember this answer from a coffee expert, but double checked my terminology via Google before commenting.', ""I think all the acid in the coffee has something to do with it, cold pressed coffee has a way more neutral PH and doesn't go bad over time like brewed coffee, it stays good in the fridge for days.,Coffee roaster here. As coffee cools and approaches room temperature our tongues can actually taste better. This is why shitty coffee is served boiling hot and shitty beer is served ice cold. What your tasting in most cases is roaster defects (negative flavor compounds) created by the roaster roasting to a prescribed temperature to achieve a ""roast profile."" (Instead they should look to produce a ""flavor profile"" specific to the coffee.) The other major culprit is when coffee is left on a burner after it's finished brewing. Once coffee is brewed it contains many different acids (chloregenic, acetic, malic etc) but if it continues to heat it begins to produce quinic acid, which tastes weird AND upsets your stomach.",1,eli5_human
"60th Anniversary Edition Fahrenheit 451, my book, is cover down on my bed. The top left corner of its back is bent, leaving the impression of a right triangle. It's an interesting idea, but it isn't exactly what I want to read while slipping into bed watching movie trailers and reading a few books before bedtime. No problem there. Here are some things to think about: How can I avoid getting caught up in the second part of the title? The title is tongue-in-cheek! It comes out on a Friday night at midnight...then turns into a Friday afternoon evening in the morning for most people here (and I'm just going off by myself). I also love the title because it has a somewhat ironic twist that treats the book as anything but merely a story of a reader who falls asleep, dreaming about the weekend adventures he or she experienced last week. ""Faster Than Light,"" by author Michael Crichton, starts with a chalkboard full of photographs from the past, including hi-res letters, names, stories of past friends, the best friend that made the trip down memory lane, and photos of the late Pablo Picasso painting ""To Be Continued."" But wait a minute...what if the title refers specifically to the book's protagonist? I don't know how many pages it takes to get through the book without repeating himselfthat was the purpose of the title itself. In fact, it took me a little bit longer than anticipated to finish Fahrenheit 451. If you're looking forward to reading Fahrenheit 451 next month, there aren't too many chances to enjoy the book when your favorite authors have already been published yet again, especially since it doesn't seem like you'll need any more time to catch up if you skip a chapter every day. Anyway...I'm not sure where the title came from outside of the title alone, but it seems pretty clear from the illustrations and the illustrations themselves that Fahrenheit 451 didn't come directly from Crichtons' work. I definitely enjoyed the story though, which might explain why I found the plot so intriguing. Someone told me one of the characters was actually a woman named Maxine. And here's a little bonus: the book contains some historical tidbits about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs along with some other tid bits scattered around too.

We had a 5 bedroom suite, and it was really great. It had enough beds for everyone, and the living room was large enough for us to hang out and have fun. The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, pots and pans, and everything else we needed. The staff at this hotel were really friendly and accommodating. We had some special requests, and they were more than willing to help us out. They even provided us with extra pillows and sheets, which was really nice. The location of the hotel is great too. It's close to all the main attractions in town, and there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. Overall, we had an amazing stay here. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff was very helpful, and the location was perfect. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Miami!",0,yelp_machine_continuation_text-davinci-003
"This is a variation of what's informally known as the [Waterfall effect] (URL0). Basically what it is is your brain trying to make sense of continuous motion, and to a point, trying to compensate for it. If that motion stops, your brain's compensation doesn't, so you perceive movement in the opposite direction. The way to visualize it is imagine one of those flat moving walkways you get at airports. If you walk backwards on one of those, just fast enough to slow but not stop yourself, that's comparable to your brain doing it's thing. If the walkway then stops, but you don't you'll now be walking in the direction opposite to the way you were. That's kinda what's happening. It's called the waterfall effect because you get the same phenomenon, but vertically if you stare at a waterfall for a minute or two, then look away at something stationary like a tree. It'll appear for a few moments to be rising.",1,eli5_human

"Following last night's election (I'm an Australian) I have seen a steady stream of comments on social media celebrating how we ""kicked out Rudd"" and the Labor party from people who, when questioned, are unable to justify their satisfaction beyond ""he fked up Australia."" I now find myself not only represented by a government who contradicts a number of my values, but a significant portion of the country doesn't seem to even know why they voted them there. I do not wish to start a debate regarding the merits of either party, I simply think that for any citizen's vote to be counted they should have to prove they have reasonable knowledge of what each party stands for and what it's plans are for the nation if elected. The idea that people who either don't care or are grossly misinformed about the election (the Murdoch anti-Rudd campaign comes to mind) are not only allowed, but REQUIRED to vote is totally unacceptable in my mind.

Children with this condition incur carelessly-repeated damage to their tongues, eyes, joints, skin, and muscles. Some die before adulthood, and others have a reduced life expectancy.[citation needed] Most people with congenital insensitivity to pain have one of five hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (which includes familial dysautonomia and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis).

"Read newspapers like the financial times or magazines like the economist. Renowned economics blogs like economist's view or grasping reality are good sources for up-to-date information. It's also important to read the speeches of top economists, like Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz or other well-known economic thinkers. While you are reading, it's important to develop the habit of taking notes. When you finish reading an article, go through it and highlight important points or findings. If you want to become a good economist, you will need to develop the habit of researching. It's not enough to read one article, then move to the next. You will need to do your own research. Find out what other economists think about a certain economic theory or current economic situation. By doing your own research, you will become more skilled at interpreting economic data and formulating your own opinions about economic theories. Everyone has their own area of interest, whether it be macroeconomics, labor economics, public finance or monetary economics. Find your area of interest and study it deeply. Become familiar with it. Learn everything you can about it. It will be a great foundation for you to build on. Economics is a complex subject. There are tons of equations, models, graphs, and other data that you will need to understand. Economics is a social science that studies the factors that affect the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. It studies the behavior of individuals, groups and nations in terms of how they allocate their resources. Economics studies the interactions between consumers, businesses, government and the economy. The field of economics is split into two main branches: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It studies the economic factors that affect the overall economy like unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), national income, inflation, and recession. Microeconomics looks at the behavior of individual consumers and businesses. It studies the decisions made by these individuals and how they affect the economy. Economics is not just a science, it's a way of thinking and a philosophy. It is a social science that relies on economists to predict the future, examine the past and explain the present. Economics deals with a variety of subjects. It looks at the distribution of income, the allocation of resources and the incentives for people to participate in the economy. It studies both the benefits of economic growth and the costs of economic growth. Economics is the study of how people, businesses and countries decide to use their resources. It studies the relationship between the scarcity of resources, the distribution of resources and the uses of resources. What is a macroeconomist? A macroeconomist studies the economy as a whole. It examines the economic factors that affect the overall economy like unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), national income, inflation and recession. A macroeconomist is an economist who focuses on the big picture. He or she looks at the overall economy and the factors that affect it. What is a microeconomist? A microeconomist looks at the behavior of individual consumers and businesses. It studies the decisions made by these individuals and how they affect the economy. A microeconomist is an economist who looks at the behavior of individual consumers and businesses. He or she looks at the factors that affect the decisions of these individuals and how these decisions affect the economy. What is the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics?

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. It studies the economic factors that affect the overall economy like unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), national income, inflation and recession. How do you become an economist? To become an economist, you need to study economics. You need to take courses in economics to learn the basic principles of economics. It's also important to take courses in other subjects such as math, accounting and statistics. How do you become a macroeconomist? To become a macroeconomist, you need to study macroeconomics.

The term football was used as the name of the sport from the 15th century onwards. The word soccer was first recorded in 1895 in the London Spectator. It was used in an article written by the editor W. T. H. [Walter Thornbury] in which he ridiculed the use of the term football to describe a sport which did not involve kicking a ball, and which was then in the process of being introduced into England from Australia. The article was called 'Soccer, Rugby and the American Game.' In it, he wrote: 'Soccer, which is a game played in numerous parts of England with a ball, is not a very attractive spectacle.'

"An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.",1,squad_human

"This paper extends the problem of 2-dimensional palindrome search into the area of approximate matching. Using the Hamming distance as the measure, we search for 2D palindromes that allow up to 3-bit words (i.e., with an average length) and have a maximum size of 8 characters. The method is based on pruning special cases in order to minimize both searching costs and the utilization of the computer memory. Although it does not require any special knowledge about palindromes or their structure, our approach generates PalindromePools. These pools are constructed by selecting two specific palindromes from all possible pairs of consecutive words, one after another, and then cross-validating using a probability distribution function. In addition, because the match rate depends strongly on word length and the accuracy of character count estimation, we employ an initial round of optimization to reduce the search space before proceeding with the more rigorous final optimization.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b
"Barry almost fell out of bed trying to reach his phone on the nightstand. The device had been vibrating and singing for almost a full minute before Barry could understand what was going on. Still half asleep he picked the phone. This was the only morning this week where he could sleep in and now it was ruined. This had better not be some stupid telemarketting call. HOLY SHIT BARRY YOU GOT TO GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE NOW! Barry jerked the phone away from his ear, the violent screaming voice probably tore his eardrum. Jesus Christ Wanda you almost blew my ear off. Oh my god, I'm sorry Barry but you really have to come to work now, please I don't know what to do! OK OK...... come down Wanda. You know I'm not due to work until noon today. Barry please! I need you here. Andrew won't return my call and Ahsley is crying in the freezer. You're the only day-time manager available, please come to work! Barry sighted. Fine..... but I'm billing Andrew double overtime for this. I'll be there in 15. Oh thank you thank you thank you! Barry hung up and got dressed. This was weird, He hadn't seen Wanda this panicked since the McLobster Incident in 2012 and Ahsley was usually a pretty level headed person. What was going on down there that would have them both in such a panic? He grabbed a leftover pizza slice from the fridge and jumped in his 2004 Honda Civic. Traffic seemed unusually heavy this morning. Going to work usually only took 10 minutes even on rush hours but for some reason traffic was ridiculous. When Barry finally made it to Main Street he understood why. A line of car almost half a mile long stretched all the way from the restaurant's drive-thru lane. The parking lot was spilling out unto the adjacent restaurants. Horn were honking and people were yelling. Above the chaos Barry could here one word over and over: Szechuan Barry entered the restaurant trough the back service door. No point in even trying to reach the front door with all these angry yelling people. He popped in head in the freezer and sure enough, Ashley was curled up in the corner, crying. Tammy was trying to console here but she looked scared helpless. Just what the hell was going on today? As soon as Wanda caught sight of Barry, she threw herself on him and hugged him with all of her strenght, tears of joy were running down her face. This is horrible Barry, I've never seen anything like this, they came out of nowhere, They're crazy! OK calm down, just tell what the fuck is happening here today It started off as any other morning. I got here 30 minutes before opening. There were a few cars already waiting in the parking. A little more than usual but it's hardly worth mentioning I mean we always have early birds. OK, go on. The first few customer were the usual morning coffee and muffin type but then some guy ordered McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. Wait, Szechuan sauce? What the hell is that? I don't know! I simply told him that we don't serve lunch meal until 10am but he wouldn't hear it, he kept demanding McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. Fucking weirdo But then, the person behind him heard us talking and got mad when he understood that we wouldn't give him his McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. Before long I had over 10 people screaming for Szechuan sauce. I DO N'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS!!! Indeed people were still screaming in the restaurant. Barry could't make out everything being said in all the commotion but Szechuan sauce and some guy named Rick kept being repeated. Wanda, who's Rick? RICK! YES! That's what they're saying. Apparently they saw some no-name obscur cartoon named Rick and Porty or whatever and he mentioned Szechuan sauce at some point. Well where the hell did he got that sauce from? I've been working here almost 10 years and I never heard about it until today. I'm not sure, something to do with 1998 and Mulan. Bary please I am freaking out here. We don't get paid enough to deal with this crazy internet meme shit Jesus Christ...... 1998. That was 20 years ago. I mean I was barely 5 back then. Barry was trying his best to put the pieces together and think of a solution before the hord of crazy maniacs out there jumped the counter. I GOT IT! Wanda looked up, wiping the tears from her eyes. What did you find? 1998! I don't remember shit from these days, nobody does! These maniacs out there, they're like us! They're young, they watch stupid internet cartoon and most of them still had a freaking diaper to their asses back in 1998. No way they actually know what Szechuan sauce is, let alone what it tastes like! Well, from what some of them yelled out, the show made it look dark brown on the alien guy's hands Alien guy? Yeah, I don't understand it either. This show must be really weird or really bad. Either way the only thing we know about Szechuan sauce is that it should be dark brown, we got nothing on taste or texture. Don't need to, these idiots will never know. Barry looked around the stocking shelves nervously until he found what he was looking for. BIGMAC SAUCE! Wanda! Get me 2 tubs of BigMac sauce and some brown-beef food coloring and tell Ashley and Tammy to get their asses out of the freezer and fire up the deep fryers, they got a shitload of McNuggets to prepare! As Barry looked at the staff tear off the lids of BigMac sauce tubs and chruning out McNuggets faster than ever before he couldn't help but to think that Wanda was right about at least one thing.

"I might get crucified for this post. Anyway, as a gay person with a mild gay tone I suppose in a sense I do it ""because I want to"" but it honestly is mostly subconscious because I can't stop without intensely conscious effort. My tone (and I've noticed discussed this with some other gay guys) actually differs depending on whom I'm talking to. If it's a very masculine guy, I will feel feminine around him and use a feminine voice. If I'm around most females or a very fem guy I'll use a more masculine tone. Again, though, I don't really realize I'm doing it. So in my opinion, it has a lot to do with ideas about sexual roles and masculinity, and may be linked to why gay men prefer men sexually. Of course though, there are gay men who have masculine voices and are even submissive in bed, but I have not met many. Typically, the more submissive you can get even a dominant gay guy, the more likely he is to use a more feminine, gentler, or higher tone. I hope this isn't offensive to those who object to my saying ""feminine"" voices sound that way, but it probably will be.

"Claire was painting her nails. As she was polishing her last nail, her cat came running. It hit the bottle and knocked it over. The bottle spilled all over her feet. The cat slid down the stairs. I saw her climbing on top of the ladder holding her nails for a second time like it belonged to her little sister. It's a pretty dramatic scene to watch. She ran off toward the house as soon as she heard the kitchen door open with the smell of cat feces coming from the front door. Her mother jumped up in surprise when she returned home. She brought Claire into the living room where her father sat watching from his bedside table by the window. His wife looked at him confusedly as she poured herself another cup of coffee. He did not respond and Claire was so sorry about the smell that she never spoke again. In the living room Claire heard her father yell: ""What happened?"" The cat hopped back onto the couch next to Claire and started licking his face with its claws. She screamed screaming until her dad dropped his dishes and threw them under the bed during a nap. He told her what had happened because he thought she ate her bathrobe while she slept and it smelled horrible. He hung towels around the house then drove Claire out of the house saying: ""You weren't supposed to come here twice. That's my responsibility!"" When the cat hits the floor Claire sees its owner crying and screams: ""Why didn't you tell me this before? I want to talk to you!"" Moments later Claire hears her father yelling for help calling out to her husband who is kneeling outside the house shouting: ""Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out!"" They tried stopping the cat but couldn't get away quickly enough to save their lives. They sent Claire to the hospital that night where Claire confessed everything after they watched her father scream himself into oblivion. After seeing Claire crying on the sidewalk Claire asked her father for forgiveness and promised to keep her brother-in law safe if she ever found out what happened to her little brother. In the meantime Claire stayed quiet giving her father the bad news hoping he could forgive her brother but they both knew nothing more than he deserved it thinking he meant no harm. Later when Claire went through a divorce proceedings court hearing she discovered there were two families separating. They buried a corpse in a grave somewhere nearby. Her father killed himself believing his daughter was dead. Claire ignored his threats making her afraid even though she feared for her life every day. When the judge ordered Claire to stay silent she begged him for forgiveness telling him she forgave him and didn't realize she would die without him forever. Eventually Claire lived happily knowing her father died trying to protect her. Today she lives alone in the house with her husband and two grown children helping her cope throughout the winter months. She loves reading paperbacks and movies and spending time outdoors exploring the mountains and lakes along the way. Her favorite thing about the mountains are the flowers blooming which make her fall asleep laughing each morning singing with her neighbors.

If you can make the bee happy by playing them the right sound they can produce more honey,"" Prof Bailie said. ""Plotting these differences could ultimately help us in our bid to find out which plants help bees the most. ""Gathering photos, video and sound files will help us understand where gaps lie and will help put plants in the right places to make bees more productive."" If enough beekeepers respond, and investigators detect initial differences, the project could be rolled out to include more than 40,000 beekeepers across the UK.",1,xsum_human
"This paper explores new evaluation perspectives for image captioning and introduces a noun translation task that achieves comparative image caption generation performance by translating from a set of nouns to captions. This implies that in image captioning, all word categories other than nouns can be evoked by a powerful language model without sacrificing performance on n-gram precision. The paper also investigates lower and upper bounds of how much individual word categories in the captions contribute to the final BLEU score. A large possible improvement exists for nouns, verbs, and prepositions.",1,sci_gen_human

"The tibia first technique with tensor measurement can be useful in predicting the soft tissue tension after implantation in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). The technique involves using a tensor to measure the ligament balance and correct any varusvalgus alignment of the knee while performing the tibial cut. This technique aims to restore the native soft tissue tension of the knee joint after joint replacement surgery. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of accurate ligament balancing and proper soft tissue tension for the overall success, function, and durability of UKAs. The tibia first technique with tensor measurement allows the surgeon to adjust the implant position and soft tissue tension to achieve a more balanced and better-functioning knee joint. This, in turn, may lead to a more successful outcome and improved patient satisfaction. However, more research and clinical studies are needed to determine the overall effectiveness of the tibia first technique in predicting the precise soft tissue tension following UKA, as well as the potential impact of various surgical approaches, implant designs, and individual patient factors on soft tissue tension and overall joint function.",0,pubmed_gpt4

"President-elect Donald Trump has named South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as the US ambassador to the United Nations, praising his former critic as ""a proven dealmaker."" Haley will be the first woman and person of color to serve in a Trump cabinet. She was elected governor of South Carolina in 2010 and is widely respected for her efforts to bring down the Confederate flag from the state's capitol building in 2015. The selection of Haley, who had previously criticized Trump's immigration policy, came as a surprise to many political observers. In her response, Haley said she was ""honored"" to be chosen, adding that she looks forward to carrying out the president-elect's vision for the UN. In a statement released by the Trump transition team, the president-elect praised Haley's record as governor, saying: ""Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country."" Trump also emphasized Haley's diplomatic skills, noting that she was an ""unwavering advocate of her state and our country."" He added that her experience working with foreign leaders would be ""invaluable"" in her new role. The appointment of Haley comes as part of Trump's effort to build a diverse cabinet, with a number of women and minorities serving in top positions. It also marks another step in the reconciliation between Trump and the Republican establishment, which had been wary of his candidacy during the election campaign. Haley will now face confirmation by the Senate before taking on her new role.",0,xsum_machine_specified_text-davinci-003
"AP McCoy, the jockey who is retiring, claims that he will not make the same decision as Sir Steve Redgrave and return to the sport. In fact, he is confident in his stance by stating that someone should harm him if he ever rides professionally again. After competing for twenty years, the rider who is now 41 years old has decided to retire from racing, having achieved over 4,000 career wins. The resolute departure of McCoy from his professional racing career brings to mind the statement made by Olympian Steve Redgrave in 1996, expressing that anyone who witnessed him getting close to a boat was authorized to shoot him. Afterwards, Redgrave had a successful comeback in the world of competitive rowing, winning his fifth Olympic gold in a row at the Sydney Games in 2000. Despite rumors of a potential change in his retirement plan, McCoy is resolute in his decision to leave the sport. The jockey who has been honored with awards admits that there are similarities in what he and Redgrave have said, but he insists that he has no plans to return. Tony McCoy's retirement is surely a sad moment for his fans, but he will forever be remembered as an exceptional athlete and one of the most remarkable competitors in the field of horse racing.",0,cnn_gpt4_para
"The smell was sickening. It was a putrid, lingering stench that permeated every floor of the apartment complex. Neighbors filed out of the building in mass hordes, clutching their noses while tears welled up in their eyes. The hazmat crew arrived with respirators and a wood ax six of them in all. Each took a floor and went through, knocking on doors and evacuating any sleeping residents, trying to locate the cause of the rotten odor. Guy was the first one to come across a locked door that yielded no response when he knocked. ""Hello? Is anyone in there? We seem to have a gas leak in the building, and we're evacuating all tenants until we've found and corrected the issue."" Even through his respirator, Guy felt like he was choking down hunks of century-old, spoiled pork. After a dozen failed attempts at making contact with the resident in apartment number 665, Guy raised his ax and hacked down into the doorframe where the knob met the wall. After he skillfully cropped out the shape of the lockset, he drove a strong foot through the wood, allowing him to enter the room with only a graceful stumble. The odor was unbearable, now. He checked his respirator mask to see if the seal was broken; it wasn't. ""Hello! Anybody here?!"" Guy shouted. He put his hand to his face reflexively, realizing that he could not stifle the smell any better with his hand than his mask could by itself. He rushed toward the single bedroom of the complex to find signs of the tenant that lived in the apartment. He opened the door, and his vision blurred because his sense of smelled was instantly overwhelmed; he tore off his mask to vomit on the floor, replacing it as soon as he stopped retching. Guy looked at the bed, which was soaked in excrement, followed a blueish leg up towards an inert torso, and then settled on an empty face whose mouth was agape. ""Miss? I'm going to need you to..... uhhhnnngg..... w-wake u-up right n-n-now..... Your apartment is no l-longer habitable..."" Guy inched towards the still body. He kept beckoning to her; no response. ""Miss?"" Guy grabbed her by the shoulder. His fingers sank into her flesh and liquid ran down her shirt. Guy gasped; he retracted immediately. Her head bobbed to the side and rolled neatly off her pillow onto the carpet by Guy's feet. Guy fell to the floor in panic, and immediately forced himself up and out of the apartment. He tore off his mask as soon as he exited the petri dish of an apartment, shouting incoherencies as he ran down the hall, looking for any living person to help him understand what he just saw. Just as Guy began fumbling down the stairs, the apartment door directly adjacent to apartment number 665 opened up.

"Anagha Nikam was travelling by rail when she spotted a mother trying to find milk for her baby daughter. She tweeted to the ministry and asked for help, and milk for the child was sent within 20 minutes. ""Anagha, the girl who wanted to help the mother and child,"" says Anagha, who is 18 and works in a call centre in Mumbai. She was travelling on a train when she saw the mother with her baby and realised she did not have milk. ""So I tweeted to the railway ministry about it, and within 20 minutes, milk was delivered to the girl,"" she says. Anagha is one of thousands of young people in India who are taking to Twitter to send complaints, queries and even compliments to ministries, local governments and government departments. And their success rate is remarkable. According to a survey by the India School of Business, nearly 70 of the responses to such tweets from the government led to a resolution. And many of those who don't get a response tweet again and again. Shubham Rungta, a 13-year-old from Ahmedabad, has asked the Gujarat government about the state of the roads in his area on several occasions. ""The roads are very bad, and the water tanks have been closed for the last two years,"" he says. Another teenager, Shrey Parekh, has been tweeting the BJP in Gujarat for the last 10 months. ""I tweeted them about bad roads and beggars on the streets. They don't have a Twitter account, but they use the hashtag BJPGujarat,"" he says. Mr Parekh says the government tweets back to him once in a while. ""I asked them to make a cremation ground for Hindus, and they said they are working on it,"" he says. Twitter began in 2006 and is now one of the world's most popular social networking sites. India has more than 20 million active users of Twitter, and in many countries the site is used to follow the daily lives of politicians and celebrities. But in India it has become a tool for people to seek the help of the government. ""Twitter is the new stomach,"" says Ms Anagha. ""I go to my parents with a problem, and they don't listen. But when I tweet, they see me as a big person and they listen."" More than 40,000 tweets have been sent to the prime minister's office over the last two months, according to its website. Twitter is also used to organise protests and campaigns, and to express dissent against government policies. When it was announced that the iconic Taj Mahal would be renovated, there was a flurry of tweets from environmentalists and heritage activists who said they would organise a protest. And when there was news of a proposal to split the state of Andhra Pradesh, tweets against the move led to more than 10,000 people marching in the city of Hyderabad. ""Twitter has become a part of our life. People are tweeting about every little thing,"" says tech entrepreneur Vijay Mallya. ""And it is affecting the way governments and corporates are thinking. They realise that this is the way people will interact."" He says there is an increasing number of political parties and public representatives using Twitter and Facebook to connect with voters. ""It is the new form of campaigning,"" he says. ""People don't want to see posters, or listen to speeches on radio. They want to know if their MP has done any work in the last five years. They want to know what their MLA is doing for them."" That is what Ms Anagha is doing. She says she has tweeted to the railway ministry several times about dirty toilets, the need for a cleaner platform at the railway station, and the lack of clean water. She says people used to mock her when she was younger, but now everyone is doing it. ""People think I am doing something good,"" she says. ""They want to do it as well, but they are not sure how to start."" Tweeting can be a powerful tool if you don't know how to do it. But you can be sure that everyone will know if you do it wrong.

My son started showing interest in coffee at the age of 18 months. He would stand on a chair, grab the coffee mug and take a sip. I had to keep an eye on him, because he would drain the cup if I didn't stop him. He used to have a lot of fun stirring cream into his coffee. My grandson, Joey, is not quite 4 and loves coffee. His parents only let him drink decaf and he loves it. My son drank coffee as a baby. The only way to get him to sleep was to rock him in a rocking chair and let him sleep in my arms. To keep him quiet, I'd give him sips of my coffee. I'd get up and down from the chair. He'd sleep in the chair, but he'd wake up if I put him down. My son is 2, and he loves coffee. He does his little dance and claps his hands when he sees me make it. He will stand on a chair and beg for a sip. The first time I let him taste it, he spit it out. He was only 18 months old. Now he loves it. It's no big deal. My son had his first sip when he was 9 months old. Now he is 15 and still drinks coffee. I grew up in Italy, where babies are given a sip of espresso with their bottle. I have a 3-month-old, and she will be drinking coffee soon, too. I am a 23-year-old mother of a 3-year-old son. He had his first sip of coffee at 2. It was decaf, and he loved it. It was only a few sips, and now he doesn't get to have it unless his father is with him to supervise. I agree that it is perfectly fine. I had my first taste of coffee when I was 2 years old. I am 42 years old now, and I love coffee. It did not hurt me. I think it's great. My 17-month-old daughter loves coffee. I have only given her a few sips. I let her have it only if she is not going to sleep. My son had his first taste of coffee when he was 6 months old.

"Ahead of a Westminster debate on the abuse faced by MPs, Labour claimed the Tories had run a ""negative, nasty campaign"" targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott in particular. It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against ""bullying and harassment."" Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like ""burn the witch."" On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with ""vitriolic abuse."" But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. ""Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,"" they wrote. ""The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. ""Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission."" They claimed Labour ""fought a positive, hopeful campaign"" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was ""surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that."" Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on ""the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections."" Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being ""driven away from politics at a time when we need them"" he said. ""This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,"" he said, claiming there had been a ""deafening silence"" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a ""significant part"" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as ""baseless.""

"The jury is rapidly nearing a verdict in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial after the defense team presented their entire case in just one day. Prosecution took two months and more than 100 pieces of evidence to accuse the former New England Patriots player of killing Odin Lloyd, who was shot six times in the chest and back on June 17, 2013. Defending his not guilty plea, Hernandez's lawyers called five witnesses to testify on Monday before resting at 3pm. Following tomorrow's closing statements, the jury will deliberate on their verdict. Scroll down for video . Nearing the end: Aaron Hernandez's defense team took just one day to deliver their case against prosecutors who spent two months producing 100 pieces of evidence. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. At the time of the killing, in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home, the tight end had a 40 million contract with the Patriots. The defense's first witness was Dr. David Greenblatt, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, who testified that the drug PCP can cause people to be suddenly violent, even days after smoking it. Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were seen smoking PCP a few days before the crime. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg went after Greenblatt's testimony, showing surveillance video of Ortiz, Wallace and Hernandez from Hernandez's home before and immediately after the killing. In the videos, the men do not appear to be acting strangely. The former New England Patriots smiles during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court . The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday . 'This is essentially three minutes after the murder - you'd expect to see something lingering of PCP psychosis or intoxication,' Bomberg said, asking if Greenblatt could detect such behavior. 'You just can't tell,' Greenblatt replied. Testimony by two other witnesses related to DNA on a shell casing found inside a silver Nissan Altima that Hernandez rented, which prosecutors say he used to drive Lloyd to his death. When police found the shell casing in a trash bin at a rental car agency, it was stuck to chewed blue bubble gum that also was found in the Nissan. In testing, Hernandez's DNA was found on the shell casing. The defense has argued it got there from the bubble gum. Hernandez lawyer James Sultan said he planned to call just three witnesses before resting later Monday. The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday.

The competitive order may also shift as Barcelona is a race where teams traditionally bring their first big upgrade package of the year. Hamilton said: ""It depends what step they make but the Red Bulls are at the back of my mind. ""They have perhaps a little more downforce than us, they just don't have as much power.

We are still having issues with his health though because they found some sort of infection growing inside his brain, either taking over or feeding off the tumor itself... They said we should monitor it closely until it resolves completely...: (They also just started him on the Lupron shots he needs every other week during his puberty years, in addition to Calcium supplements daily, since apparently calcium may play a part in how well your body's hormones work... He will be seeing the endocrinologists regularly too after they take care of the infection first... My husband told me yesterday if something like this happened to him while my children were young - neurologically speaking- the likelihood would probably be more severe than mine simply due to age and stress combined...

"The ball was a month ago and all the shoe stores had started carrying glass shoes as that had become the craze since word of the prince's quest to find the woman with the matching shoe had spread throughout all of the kingdom. It seemed glass was the only footwear to be found on the feet of royalty and peasants alike. There were even whispers of making glass boots too, apparently, even the men were getting swept away in the frenzy. The prince was so insistent he decreed for the slipper to be inspected by every shoemaker in the kingdom to determine where it had originated from- perhaps a sorceress had transformed an ordinary slipper into glass. Once identified, woe be to the poor shoemaker were he to be unable to recall it's purchaser. Cinderella's step-sisters were clumsy and their insistence at wearing the delicate things was cause for much frustration on her part. Not only were her days filled with the usual- mopping, sweeping, laundry, etc, - but now she must clean and redress each girls' pair of feet as they kept breaking the slippers and getting cut. Additionally, as these girls were next-level crazy, she was making increasingly frequent trips to various shoe stores to replace the broken ones. Each new pair was a size bigger than previous as the swelling of the feet never went down. It was for this reason that Cinderella could be found perusing the shoemaker's spoils this Tuesday morning. As a further demonstration of the effects the notorious missing shoe was having on the kingdom, shoemakers and glassblowers are now sharing their trade's secrets with each other as means to achieve the highest quality products. They now set up shop next to each other for convenience. The shoemaker, Sir Fjor, seemed out of sorts this morning, he could barely manage a nod in Cinderella's direction when she approach his merchandise. He was standing beyond his crystal shoes, barely visible under the canopy overhead. ""Henry? You look so upset? What has happened?"" He was shaking and he jumped at the sound of her voice, visibly bringing him back to the marketplace setting, he had clearly been elsewhere. ""I-, I made this. It was me."" ""You did?"" Cinderella couldn't breathe. She had been busy since the ball trying to convince herself that she couldn't possibly be the only dame to attend wearing glass slippers. Surely another girl, clumsy as she was, could have lost her's as easily as Cinderella had. Surely. Surely. ""I received it only just this morning by courier."" He turned to meet her gaze. ""Cinderella, I can not recall making this shoe, silk or not. But there is my trademark. I'll deny it's mine, the mark is smudged anyway. The next shoemaker can give it a look."" ""Sir Fjor, may I look at it?"" Cinderella felt the smooth weight of glass fill her hand. It's design and build familiar to her as she had spent endless hours examining its twin- remembering, dancing, dreaming. She could see his face now, conjuring it from her memory, never far from the forefront of her mind. She remembered feeling of his arm wrapped around her waist while she allowed herself to get lost in the memory of his icy blue eyes. His dark amber brows framed them, offering a nice contrast, easing movement of an onlookers gaze across his flawless, fair-skinned face. In the moment, she had raised her left hand to be placed his his- and the glass slipper fell and shattered on the ground at the shoemaker's feet, sending shards of glass rocketing in every direction, a few lodging themselves into her bare calves. ""Cinderella! What have you done!"" She jumped, her dream clearing from her mind and she looked down at the mess she had created. ""Mr. Fjor! I'm so sorry! I'll clean it up!"" She could feel the hem of her dress sweeping the now-forming beads of blood across the rest of her calf as she spun around in a flurry for something to collect the broken glass in. A crowd had begun to gather at the commotion and whispers began to spread of the clumsy girl who had broken the prince's slipper. Moments later guards had arrived and were taking Sir Fjor away as the crowd looked on, Cinderella screaming her protests at them, shouting that she had been the one to break the slipper. But to no avail. Cinderella went home that night without the glass slippers for her step sisters and with a tortured conscience full of guilt, her voice was hoarse. She couldn't sleep that night, tossing and turning. What could she have done? She needed to do something. And by morning she had a plan. She waited for dawn's light to fill her room, any action sooner and she would have woken the whole house, and walked to her closet. Digging around, deep into the back, she pulled out the blue ball gown. Laying that on her bed, she sat down at her mirrored desk and began trying her best to recreate the princess Fairy Godmother had made her into that night. When she was finished she had GusGus fetch her necklace and fasten it for her. The birds were chirping at her with questions she would answer as she stepped into the dress they were holding, flapping their wings in time with each other. She swept down the near-vacant cobbled streets of Happily Ever After, encountering only a few early-morning peasants, who would turn and gawk at her as she strode by. When she reached the castle, she raised her gloved hand and firmly knocked. She could hear it's echoes resounding through the corridor on the opposite side. In time, a servant came and met her. Her apparel was enough to render the servant speechless, and she placed her in a room without a spoken word, save only ask, ""Charming?"" And with a nod from Cinderella, the servant was off to fetch the prince. While she waited, Cinderella cross the room and placed the shoe atop the desk, arranging it in a way that it would be the first thing he would see upon his entrance. When he entered the confused and irritated expression in face transformed into tears of joy as his eyes slid from the slipper to Cinderella behind it. He cross the distanced between them and swept her up in his arms. And they lived happily every after.",1,wp_human
"Duties vary, but a lot of it is essentially diplomacy and politics. Although by convention not stating political views publicly, the Queen is kept up to date with government developments through her private secretary. The monarch's role as head of state does not mean she has control over domestic issues such as foreign affairs or defence policy: these are matters that fall under the influence of cabinet members in the Government who have to be approved by Parliament for each matter individually. The official role of Her Majesty consists mainly of duties associated with keeping order at ceremonial events such as royal weddings, funerals, investitures (including coronations), and coronation processions, assuming responsibility for ensuring that public funds used on this activity are directed appropriately.[1] However, until January 2015, the queen had no formal exercise powers beyond attending State Banquets; however, since then, after a new Statutory Instrument took effect from 1st April 2015, she can now attend Cabinet meetings - although decisions made during them cannot take effect before 30 days have passed unless specifically stated otherwise[2]. She also receives ambassadors and other envoys and attends international gatherings,[34], though these do not necessarily require attendance of ministers. During any period when an event takes place which causes her to leave London, the monarch usually stays at Windsor Castle while Whitehall remains closed due to security concerns; whilst abroad she will typically stay either in one of the country residences within driving distance, or in Buckingham Palace.[5] When visiting overseas countries, including Commonwealth realms, she may travel to another location rather than return to Westminster. In addition to all those diplomatic roles, there is additional work relating closely to national interest, particularly involving military personnel serving outside of the UK. This includes being aware of the activities and interests of potential adversaries, advising British troops about their safety, and making personal visits to the families and friends of missing servicemen and women who are believed to be in danger.[6] Since 911 and the launch of Operation Temperer in 2003, the Queen has been involved in sustained operations against al-Qaeda elements in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Known as 'Operation TENGO', the QEII led a number of small specialist teams under orders provided by MI6 while stationed in Kabul between 2004 and 2006. Their deployment was intended primarily to hunt down the remaining Taliban leadership operating in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of most British combat forces.[7] In December 2007, the Queen announced plans to reduce the size of the armed forces from 536,000 to 500,000 by 2010.[8] This included hundreds of thousands of civilian staff working alongside the army, navy and air force, plus an extra 150,000 frontline soldiers and sailors.[9] Almost every day, Buckingham Palace would receive media requests asking how many male and female officers were still posted away from home, whether they were leaving soon, and so forth. Takeaways became increasingly popular because the palace kitchens couldn't cope. Across Europe, guard services would similarly suffer shortages - people could say anything to get into Buckingham House if you knew where to look. It got pretty funny sometimes.10]",0,eli5_machine_continuation_opt_2.7b

"Recently, a large number of efficient deep learning methods for solving inverse problems have been developed and show outstanding numerical performance. For these deep learning methods, however, a solid theoretical foundation in the form of reconstruction guarantees is missing. In contrast, for classical reconstruction methods, such as convex variational and frame-based regularization, theoretical convergence and convergence rate results are well established. In this paper, we introduce deep synthesis regularization (DESYRE) using neural networks as nonlinear synthesis operator bridging the gap between these two worlds. The proposed method allows to exploit the deep learning benefits of being well adjustable to available training data and on the other hand comes with a solid mathematical foundation. We present a complete convergence analysis with convergence rates for the proposed deep synthesis regularization. We present a strategy for constructing a synthesis network as part of an analysis-synthesis sequence together with an appropriate training strategy. Numerical results show the plausibility of our approach.",1,sci_gen_human

"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. ""My mum was a very special person who lived her life with love and kindness. She had an incredible sense of humour and was always happy to share it with others. I have never known my mum not to be smiling or laughing, despite what her physical illness may have told us otherwise. She was very independent from a young age and this self-sufficiency allowed her to enjoy many things in life including being involved in numerous volunteer roles throughout her lifetime; she volunteered for many charities such as The British Legion, Royal British Legion, Capability Browning, YMCA, St Barnabas Hospice Care and other local organisations like our own cancer charity Tandem Cancer Care. ""My dad worked for BHS for over 30 years and he loved every minute of that time working there alongside so many great people - they were all like family to him. He couldn't work without them and would often surprise me with stories about their day at work. Even when watching the news together, even then, he still enjoyed talking politics and history. If you wanted something done, he could get it finished, no matter how small. He also loved taking care of lawns and gardens in his spare time. When we moved house, he managed to finish all of ours without help while enjoying these hobbies too. In particular, building stools out of wood for our patio and garden for two summer seasons in a row! My mum would have been so disappointed if she knew that this hobby wasn't going to continue due to my father's health issues. ""She would also tell stories about her own childhood growing up in Australia during World War II which gave her a sense of pride and belonging. Her parents came here to Britain aged 20 to try their hand at doing business and establish a legacy through selling goods and services via their company. They both died within three months of each other after immigrating to Britain in 1941. As a result of this tragedy, my mum made sure her children had a strong connection to their Australian heritage and taught them to speak English properly clearly and confidently whenever necessary because she felt important language skills and cultural awareness are vital for a successful future career. ""We now live in France but my mum visited London regularly throughout her lifetime. Most recently, before living independently, she arrived back from France earlier than expected (due to having pneumonia) only to find that her GP advised against travelling home and insisted that we stay put instead. We decided that we'd all come here at the same time rather than flying separately since it would have meant more money spent on plane tickets and quarantine costs whilst in isolation. It was difficult keeping her mobile phone running long enough to make any phone calls although my uncle helped greatly along the way.

"It's largely because of your ability to perceive motion. Your brain is good at a lot of things, and vision is one of them. It's constantly filling in gaps and seamlessly weaving events together - even if you're driving or walking through the same scenery day after day. But it does so without being able to actually see each individual pixel on the screen (or video feed). That phenomenon has been called ""inattentional blindness"" by cognitive psychologist Daniel Simons, who first coined the term in 1984. In his study, subjects were asked to watch an interview with university president John Kennedy Smith while he spoke about astronomy. The subject was framed as a joke: When they heard ""the only thing we have to fear,"" some people thought that NASA had discovered another planet. Others of course knew what happened next. So when Smith said, ""it turns out there are two planets. One is Venus, and the other, I kid you not, is Pluto."" The original group didn't realize this until time expired during the interview. They then counted how many times their attention shifted away from the camera, and found themselves watching a news program for several minutes afterward. A common reaction might be skeptical laughter or eye rolling. That isn't necessarily wrong; plenty of people will say something like ""well duh!"" and point toward the sky up above. And those responses can certainly be illuminating - if you care enough to ask questions. A better response would recognize that our brains aren't bad at perception but rather just concentrate on certain aspects, especially where human interest lies. Sometimes those details may seem mundane - such as if somebody says the temperature outside is 98 degrees Fahrenheit, almost nobody notices anything else. On others, however, such as football players celebrating touchdown passes, smiling families gathering around carousels, dogs greeting fishermen returning home, or children clamoring over candy, we notice everything going on. We do so even though most of us don't consciously register all that stuff every single second. ""If you look into music videos or movies or television shows about sports, you'll always catch me looking off-screen somewhere. If you really want to capture my awareness of the environment, I'm getting ready to go fishmin', mowing grass, doing something outdoors. You won't get me fishing, though."" - Jim Whiteley, musician ""Whenever you hear a new song, the moment it starts playing, you start listening more intently than usual. This is due to 'listening fatigue,' which occurs whenever someone tries to listen attentively to too much information. As soon as the listener gets tired of hearing the song, they turn to whatever task they've got going on right now."" - Pete Yorn, singersongwriter The problem comes partly because of the way humans process stimuli and interact with objects in real life. Our minds aren't entirely rational, and often focus on images that make sense to us, whether they originate from reality or not. Such processes include associating patterns and symbols with meaning and context, preparing ourselves mentally for upcoming tasks and tasks completed hours ago, and maintaining current contexts in order to remember past experiences. All these causes implicitly produce false positive memory errors, resulting in missing important nuances in imagery and audio feeds. Stick your head between your knees! All sorts of fields use this method of cognition. Some researchers use it to test how well people understand scenes based on simple geometric shapes. Why? Because shapes tend to create visual associations between items in space, leading to vivid mental representations. Shapes also occupy relatively little room compared to the vastness of actual environments, making them easier to visualize than large landscapes. Even though subjects rarely report noticing their surroundings, research suggests that pattern recognition tends to happen unconsciously. And subconscious image matching happens frequently throughout daily lives. More studies have shown similar results. For instance, psychologists working under Michael Posner used a laser pointer to animate pictures that seemed unrelated to any sort of specific object or person. Subjects saw abstract drawings flash across a computer monitor, only before discovering that it was done for scientific purposes. Nowhere did participants know they'd seen it before, yet nearly everyone reported seeing the animation once it finished. Other experiments using colored lights flashed behind words printed on paper showed that observers could accurately identify colors despite having no idea what the word meant. While some people claimed to guess correctly, the majority weren't sure. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't quite place the color associated with the word. These findings suggest that to varying extents, we use unconscious cues to determine what seems familiar, even if we later claim otherwise. How do scientists figure this out? Psychologists provide volunteers with special goggles - one red lens allows light to pass through whereas the other blocks it. At random intervals, specially designed lights fire behind multiple images, like colorful dots popping up on a movie screen. People wearing the goggles visually match light sources with the ones appearing within circles drawn onto posterboards placed beside each image.

"Earthly is a build automation tool that executes builds in containers, making them self-contained, repeatable, portable, and parallel. It uses the same technology as Docker, but Earthly is designed to be an easy-to-use tool for the build engineer, rather than an infrastructure tool for operations. The concept is simple: you create a container image that contains your build environment and your source code, and then run the container on a build server. Earthly builds are portable and can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, and have a number of additional features like file locks, DNS proxying, and the ability to send e-mails.

"The recently introduced dropout training criterion for neural networks has been the subject of much attention due to its simplicity and remarkable effectiveness as a regularizer, as well as its interpretation as a training procedure for an exponentially large ensemble of networks that share parameters. In this work we empirically investigate several questions related to the efficacy of dropout, specifically as it concerns networks employing the popular rectified linear activation function. We investigate the quality of the test time weight-scaling inference procedure by evaluating the geometric average exactly in small models, as well as compare the performance of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean more commonly employed by ensemble techniques. We explore the effect of tied weights on the ensemble interpretation by training ensembles of masked networks without tied weights. Finally, we investigate an alternative criterion based on a biased estimator of the maximum likelihood ensemble gradient.",1,sci_gen_human

"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a brave knight named John. John was known far and wide for his bravery and courage, and was known for slaying many dragons in his time. One day, John was summoned by the King and tasked with a new quest - to slay a dragon that had been terrorizing nearby villages. The King promised a generous reward for the completion of this quest, and John set out immediately. As he journeyed through the kingdom, John gathered information about the dragon's whereabouts and strengths. He heard that the dragon was immensely powerful, with scales as hard as steel and the ability to breathe fire. John knew that this would be no ordinary battle, but he had never shied away from a challenge before. When John finally came face to face with the dragon, he was taken aback. The dragon was unlike any he had seen before - immense, powerful, but also strangely beautiful. As he got closer to the dragon, John realized that the dragon was none other than his beloved wife, Elizabeth. Stunned, John stepped back and tried to take in what he was seeing. He didn't know how or why his wife had been turned into a dragon, but he knew that he couldn't simply slay her. John struggled with his emotions, feeling torn between his love for his wife and his duty to the King. Finally, after much deliberation, John came up with a plan. He approached the dragon and spoke to it, hoping that some part of his wife remained within the creature. To his surprise and relief, the dragon responded to his words. John recognized his wife's voice in the deep growl of the dragon, and knew that there was still a chance to save her. Over the course of several weeks, John worked tirelessly to find a way to turn his beloved wife back into a human. He traveled far and wide, seeking out wise old wizards and sorcerers who might know how to reverse the curse. Finally, after much searching, he found someone who claimed to be able to reverse the spell. John raced back to the dragon's lair, his heart pounding with excitement and fear. He approached the dragon once again, this time with the intention of performing the spell to turn his wife back into a human. The dragon allowed him to come close, and John began to recite the incantation. To his great joy, the spell worked! The great dragon shrank down, its scales melting away to reveal John's wife Elizabeth. She was weak and disoriented at first, but quickly regained her strength. John took her in his arms, overjoyed to have his wife back. Together, John and Elizabeth returned to the village, where they were greeted as heroes. The villagers hailed John as a brave knight, and Elizabeth as the beautiful woman she had always been. In time, John was able to forgive the person who had placed the curse upon his wife, but he never forgot the trial he had faced in his quest to save her. And he lived happily ever after with Elizabeth, vowing to cherish her always.",0,wp_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo

"For a horror film, this is criminally dull. Plagued by an uninspired plot and forgettable characters, the film fails to deliver on its promise of spine-tingling scares and mind-bending twists. Instead, it trudges along, riddled with cliches and relying on tired jump scares that fizzle out after the first act. The visuals, while competently executed, lack the atmospheric flair and sinister ambiance that horror aficionados crave. What's more, it's hard to root for our protagonist, a one-dimensional character who inexplicably makes poor decisions at every turn, making it near impossible for the audience to feel invested in their plight. The supporting cast is equally unremarkable, save for the occasional moment of unintentional humor in a futile attempt to break the monotony. Furthermore, the film buckles under the weight of its unwieldy pacing - its drawn-out scenes make it feel like an eternity before the plot truly kicks into gear. When the climactic revelation finally shuffles into view, it falls spectacularly flat due to the audience's already exhausted patience. One can't help but feel that there was potential here for a truly unique and terrifying experience. Alas, like a nightmare that escapes your mind the moment you wake, this tangle of missed opportunities will quickly fade from your memory. There is little to recommend in this film, and horror fans would be better off exploring the depths of terror in the myriad other, far superior offerings in the genre.",0,imdb_gpt4

"The paper deals with the problem of deciding if two finite-dimensional linear subspaces over an arbitrary field are identical up to a permutation of the coordinates. This problem is referred as sequence homology, and it has applications in algebraic geometry (as well as other areas). Let X be a vector space over mathbb{Fp} imes mathbb{F}q where p q. Then we may assume that for every min [0;1], there exists a nonzero element bmcmge 0 such that the following holds: If (xn) y{n1} (x) e0, then bx-y. If (xn) y{n1} (x), then b x. Otherwise, bmcm0. For example consider a 2D manifold M, and suppose that we want to not only determine whether C2 is a proper subset of this manifold but also is a proper subset of itself. We could define the metrics on C by the standard way using metric spaces, or we may use sequences since they allow us to find metrics which can satisfy both of these properties simultaneously. For instance, let L:mathbf{P}X o{mathcal {M denote the metric connected component of the fiber bundle of C2, and let T (lambda t):X ightarrow L be the trace map defined by T (tC) liml0 1T (t,C) on Riemann surfaces. From our definition above, we know that if the columns of C have the same cardinality, then C must contain all points of the source space and hence must be proper subsets of each other. Since in general, lambda 0, we cannot express this condition in terms of T, so for the moment, let's keep R restricted to Riemann surfaces. Now suppose that we wish to construct a sequence D of metrics from V. Let AV[a] be a subset of V and let A' V[ab]. The category of functions from X to Y consists of functors f: G o Y and g: F o Y, where G denotes the group of symmetries of G. So actually, since D need not necessarily be defined on some Riemann surface, we should be able to formulate the question in this form directly. Specifically, suppose that we are given a finite set of vectors viin X and wiin C[zj], and w' (vj) w' (vk) (w (vj (w' (vk . In other words, we just need to get rid of w' (vj) . Now we replace vi in W by zj and we change the order of W and its corresponding fibration B accordingly. By continuity, we know that D (lambda) d (a-b) g (ab) -d (a-b) converges, so there needs to exist some cin C[zj]. However, we don't care about c anymore because we will always obtain the following relationship between D and D (lambda) : d (A - d (A) 0 orall B g (ab); d (A g (a-b) }0. Since the image of the image of a function f under the symmetry g doesn't depend upon any particular morphism h, GKL gives a closed formula for g. Furthermore, it shows the existence of a unique H such that D (lambda) d (a-b) g (ab) -d (a-b) H-D (g) (ab) , implying that since D depends only on vi and wi, g does too. Unfortunately, many results concerning HEP in generalized vector spaces can in fact be stated much more generally than the ones obtained in the paper mentioned earlier. Thus, one would expect that a similar result on signed distances would be known elsewhere. To illustrate this point further, suppose that we have the usual canonical sum S (s1, s2,..., smn) , and let U be a unit ball in the basis consisting of the vectors vi s1,...,smn. Then if g (si,u) 0, then si commute with - have- 'ndunlimited In The The amount possible plus",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b

"Two police officers who a judge said gave inconsistent and unconvincing evidence to an inquest in to the death of an IRA man are to be reported to prosecutors. The two officers, who have not been named, are accused of giving false testimony during the inquest into the death of Seamus Ludlow in 1997. Ludlow, a 47-year-old father of three, was abducted and killed by a loyalist gang in 1976. His body was found in a ditch in Co Louth, close to the border with Northern Ireland. At the time, the RUC said they had no suspects and the case remained unsolved. However, in 1979, the Sunday World newspaper named four men it said were responsible for the killing. In 1996, the Irish government set up an independent inquiry into the murder, which heard that the RUC had failed to properly investigate the case and had failed to interview the four men named by the Sunday World. The inquiry also heard that the RUC had failed to tell the Ludlow family that one of the four men, James Fitzsimmons, had confessed to the killing while he was in prison in Northern Ireland. Fitzsimmons later retracted his confession, but the Ludlow family believe he was involved in the killing and that the RUC knew this but failed to act. In 2016, the High Court in Belfast ruled that there was enough evidence to justify holding an inquest into Ludlow's death. The inquest began in April 2018 and heard from a number of witnesses, including the two police officers. Judge Liam McCollum said in his ruling that the two officers had given ""inconsistent and unconvincing"" evidence and that there were ""serious questions"" about their credibility. He said there was enough evidence to warrant referring the officers to the Public Prosecution Service to consider whether they should be charged with perjury. The Ludlow family welcomed the judge's ruling and said they hoped the officers would now be prosecuted.",0,xsum_machine_topical_text-davinci-002

"Because you don't see with the part of the eye that has colors. Thats just where your muscles are for the Iris.,"" ""It's entirely possible one person may perceive color differently than another. My green could be your blue. I don't see what eye color would have to do with it though. All that matters is what comes through the cornea. It's like saying cameras of two different colors process light differently. The color of the casing doesn't matter. What would matter is if their sensors are operating the same way.,Light entering the eye can be measured objectively in wavelengths. When a traffic light turns red the same wavelength (and therefore colour) is entering the eyes of both observers. However, the sensation of ""seeing"" red, that is to say how it ""feels"" is something that can't be measured with scientific instruments. The direct experience can't be shared between individuals, only described indirectly. Such sensations that cannot be measured or shared, only experienced, are known as Qualia. URL1 So there's two components to your vision, the quantifiable properties of the photons that enter your eye, and your own unquantifiable experience caused by your body's response to those photons. Edit: regarding eye colour, as other posters have said, the function of your iris is the same as the aperture on a camera, it's a hole that changes size to regulate how much light is coming in. Light doesn't pass through the coloured part so the wavelength entering your eye should be minimally or not-at-all affected by the colour of the muscles regulating your eye's aperture. An interesting side note regarding eye colour: brown irises are that colour because of the pigment they contain, chiefly melanin. Blue eyes are caused by an absence of pigment, the blue colour you see is due to Rayleigh Scattering, which is the same process that causes our sky to look blue. URL0', ""The iris (the colored part of your eye) is simply just a muscle to expand and contract to allow light into the eye. The pupil then regulates how much light is allowed in to your eye. Neither of these affect colors, since colors are mainly seen with the'cone' portion of your eyes. Also, it's possible to turn brown eyes blue with a simple laser procedure since most eyes have an underlying blue in them, simply hiding behind brown.,"" ""Vsauce made a very nice video about that topic: URL2 It might help you! And, for what it's worth, it's very interesting.;),"" ""There are people with heterochromia (eyes are different colors) and they haven't told us they see differently from each eye.",1,eli5_human

"A bubble is a broad term, so you'll get variations on what defines one. With that in mind, it refers to an economic scenario where an asset's demand and price increase in an irrational way, as opposed to the underlying fundamentals that normally drive it. You could say the asset has become ""de-coupled"" from its fundamentals. There are always multiple factors in creating a bubble, but common factors are a ""perfect storm"" of economic circumstances, cheap credit and often fraud. In housing you had 1) A lot of foreign and institutional money searching for safe, stable investments (which they found in the form of mortgage-backed securities), 2) very low interest rates because of the dotcom recovery (cheap creditloans), 3) american consumers looking for safe money havens after the dotcom blowout (you can live in a house, you can't live in a stock), 4) cheap construction loans (low interest rates). And other more esoteric but critical factors, like the creation of an investment product called a 'CDO', and the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act in 1999 (Clinton signed off on this, btw), which prevented banks from engaging in the investment business. During the housing bubble, banks were essentially gambling with home loans in the markets. They made hundreds of billions and thought they had a sure thing. So why not issue more loans to have more gambling money? This is why subprime loans got big: as homes got too expensive, subprime was a way to lower the borrowers monthly payment and keep selling more homes. There's also a psychological enforcement component that keeps prices going up. Like in housing, Joe Blow paid 200k for his house. Two years later, he sells it for 300k. The following year, the new owner sells for 500k. People start to believe that 1) The price always goes up, and 2) It's a can't lose financial decision because if anything goes wrong (job loss, divorce, etc), you can just sell for more than you paid. That makes buyers even less risk averse. So the normally rational consumer who would not even be in the housing market now decides he wants a piece of the action. In fact, the biggest risk is not getting in before the price goes too high and you're ""priced out."" This is called a feedback loop, sometimes called ""the greater fool"" theory. It's the positive reinforcement andor fear-driven motivation for people to keep participating in the market despite their feelings that maybe it's all bullshit. As long as there's a ""greater fool"" to buy this house, my investment can't lose. At some point, prices become so decoupled with fundamentals that if anything changes in ""the fantasy"" the whole thing is at risk. It could have been interest rates, an increase in unemployment, etc. In the case of housing, what happened is that even with all the whacko loan options, many people simply couldn't afford even a starter home. If no one is buying starters, then the people in starters can't sell and move up to nicer homes, and so on. At some point people just say, ""Fuck it, I'll just rent."" Demand collapses. But you paid 500k for that starter home. Or maybe you bought five homes as investments. Hell no, you're not going to sell for less and take a loss! Housing always goes up! It will come back in a month. But it doesn't, and now you can't make the payments. You foreclose. Now there's yet another house in the supply. And uh oh, there's a million builders out there cranking out houses left and right! So demand collapsed but supply is still going up! You get the idea. Now you have a crash. There's a very good book called Irrational Exuberance by Robert Schiller, that does a great job of explaining the psychology and economics of Bubbles, though it's sometimes a technical read.', ""While ubillbixbyakahulk gave a longer answer, the basis of financial bubbles is actually very simple: I've got something. It's valuable. You want the valuable something, so you pay me for it. Someone else wants it: they are willing to pay more than you paid for it, so you sell it to them. Now the price is going up, which means we know it's valuable: not only is it valuable by itself, but it's also valuable because the price is going to go up: it's an investment. Now more people want it, so the price goes up more. And because it's an investment, I borrow money to buy more things, and then sell them, and make money, and pay off my loan. And more people do this, because you can make money buying and selling things. .... And then something happens, and people stop buying as many of the thing. Now it's not as interesting, so prices stop going up. And because prices aren't going up, people don't see it as an investment, so they don't want it as much; and prices start going down. And now it's a bad investment, and people start selling, and prices go down really fast. And some people get left with low-value things and high-value loans. And that's a bubble.",1,eli5_human

"Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.:33 He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.:282 Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail. In late 1886, Tesla moved to New York City to work for Thomas Edison, who had been developing a direct current (DC) power system. Edison had also been developing a system of electrical lighting based on high resistance incandescent electric lamps. It was at this time that Tesla conceived the rotating magnetic field principle. Tesla claimed that the insight into the rotating magnetic field principle came to him while he was walking with a friend in a city park with a stick in his hand, and was pondering the question of how it was possible for an alternating current to pass through a single wire. Tesla's demonstrations in his laboratory of wireless lighting and other phenomena attracted the attention of the media. Tesla wrote a letter to Robert Underwood Johnson, a prominent editor of Century Magazine. The letter arrived while Johnson was preparing the magazine's December 1900 issue, with the theme ""Current Wars."" Johnson asked Tesla for an article on his views, which became the magazine's lead article in the January 1901 issue. In the article, ""The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,"" Tesla described the benefits of polyphase alternating current and compared it to direct current. In the late 1890s, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of ""invisible"" kinds after he had observed unusual signals from his machines when operating in high voltages. Tesla suspected that he was observing Standing waves in his circuits which would ""flash over"" to a ""resonant receiver"" in the form of light, sound, or mechanical movement. Tesla was one of the first researchers to start to unravel the mysteries of radio communication. Tesla's circuit designs for his lighting inventions used two-phase alternating current, which generated no harmonic radiations, a form of electromagnetic interference. When Tesla was working on ideas for a brushless motor in the late 1880s, he came up with the idea that he might be able to use a magnetic field to run a motor without brushes or a commutator. However, he found it difficult to obtain funding to develop the new motor, which Tesla claimed would run on alternating current and would not waste energy in heat. Eventually, in 1887, Tesla obtained the funding for the project from two of his wealthy friends: Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail. In the same year, Tesla began construction of the A.C. motor at his Houston Street lab. In June 1888, Tesla was able to demonstrate a running model of his A.C. motor. On 16 May 1888, Tesla filed a patent on an electrical motor that used rotating magnetic fields, which is seen as the basis of modern alternating current (AC) motor. Tesla would eventually sell the patent to George Westinghouse. Tesla's experiments also led him to patent a design for a ""coil for electromagnets"" in 1888. The Tesla coil is widely used today in radio technology. That year, Tesla began investigating what would later be called X-rays using his own vacuum tubes to generate them. Others who worked with these devices include Ivan Pulyui, Johann Hittorf, Eugen Goldstein, and Wilhelm Rontgen who, in 1895, noticed several invisible rays projected from the side of the tube while he was experimenting with vacuum tubes and various other early X-ray experiments. Rontgen referred to the radiation as ""X,"" to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Rontgen'",0,squad_machine_continuation_30B

"It's not held in place by electricity, but rather a mechanical lock. It's not terribly unlike the lock on the door of your house, in that it has metal pieces that slide into other metal pieces, and if you have the right key, then the lock slides open. Now, the problem with locks is that they're not perfect. Someone can come along and pick your lock with a credit card, if they're lucky, or with a lockpick if they're good, or even just with a good old-fashioned battering ram if they're mad or desperate enough. The number of locks on a safe also tends to vary according to the security it's offering. A safe that's just for your old papers and the odd piece of jewellery might only have one lock on it, while a safe that holds highly sensitive information might have four, or even five, locks on it. One of the big tricks that safe manufacturers use is that they make it so that you need multiple keys to open the safe. Most safe locks, like your front door, use a flat key, but unlike your front door, the key that opens the lock is usually a skeleton key, which looks a lot like a moustache. It fits in the keyhole, and turns, but the narrow, skeleton key will only open one lock, and a regular key won't open the lock. So, the first thing you've got to do is pick the lock. This isn't difficult, so long as you have the right tool. The most common safe lock pick is the rake, a long metal object that you insert into the lock, and wiggle about while you turn the lock. If you've got the right key, and you're lucky, then the lock will turn, and open the safe for you. If you're not lucky, then the rake will just bounce off the pins inside the lock, and you'll need to try again. The second thing you need to do is pick the other locks. This is the more difficult part, and it's where the skeleton keys come in. You've probably heard the phrase, ""picking the lock,"" and the truth is, you don't actually pick a lock. You pick the lock, which is to say, you turn it, like you're turning the key. What you're picking is the pins, by making them fall into place, which is to say that you're pushing them up with your pick. If you're very lucky, you can pick a safe in a matter of minutes. You can pick the lock with the rake, and then pick each of the other locks with their own skeleton keys, and you'll be able to open the safe, and get at the treasure inside. On the other hand, you might have to spend hours, or even days, picking the lock, and then picking the other locks, because you don't have the right tools. A safe that's been well looked after, and that's been opened a lot of times, is going to be an easier lock to pick than a safe that's never been opened. The third thing you need to do is bypass the combination lock. A combination lock is an extra lock, usually found on the inside of a safe. It's a lock that's activated by a code, which the owner of the safe inputs by turning dials. Each dial has a set of numbers on it, and you input the code by turning each dial to the right number, in the right order. The dials are connected to gears, and the gears are connected to a wheel that slides into the lock. If you input the right code, then the wheel will turn, and the safe will be opened. Sometimes, you can just bypass the combination lock by breaking it open, but this isn't always a good idea. It's a lot easier to break open a combination lock than it is to pick a safe, but it's not always the best idea. The safe will be damaged, and the combination lock is usually part of the locking mechanism, which means that the safe won't be able to be closed again. Sometimes, you can just bypass the combination lock by picking it. A combination lock can be picked, with a bit of time and luck. All you've got to do is push the pins into place, and turn the dials, until the wheel turns, and the safe opens. If you've got time, then you can pick the combination lock. If you've got time, then you can pick the other",0,eli5_machine_continuation_30B

They have been accused of using the psychoactive substance PCP during Lloyd's murder. The prosecutors have presented over a hundred pieces of evidence in the past two months to support their claim that Hernandez planned the shooting in June 2013. One of the three men accused of the murder is Hernandez, who had been part of the Patriots team when Lloyd died. He is denying responsibility for all accusations. The jury is anticipated to listen to concluding remarks on Tuesday and come to a decision soon after. Hernandez could be sentenced to spend his whole life in prison without any chance of being released, if found guilty.",0,cnn_gpt4_para
"There is experimental evidence that supports the concept that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at threonine 668 (T668) influences its processing and association with centrosomes. Studies have shown that phosphorylation of APP at T668 occurs during mitosis and is highly restricted to dividing cells. This phosphorylation event seems to play a role in the observed altered processing of APP and generation of amyloid-beta (A) peptides, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Phosphorylated APP at T668 (pT668-APP) has been found to accumulate in centrosomes during mitosis. Centrosomes play a key role in cell division, as they are involved in the formation of mitotic spindles that ensure proper chromosome segregation. The localization of pT668-APP at centrosomes suggests that it may participate in the regulation of cell division. Moreover, it has been reported that the altered processing of APP, associated with the generation of A peptides, is regulated by cell cycle-dependent kinases that control the phosphorylation of APP at T668. Inhibition of these kinases affects the generation of A, highlighting the importance of this phosphorylation event in APP processing. Overall, APP phosphorylation at T668 during mitosis may affect its processing and lead to its association with centrosomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the relevance of this phosphorylation event, its role in cell cycle regulation, and implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.",0,pubmed_gpt4
"Using tailored optical pulses, scientists can reshape the electron clouds of atoms and molecules to give them specific properties. The technique can make almost anything look or act like any other material, for example, it can turn ordinary materials into superconductors. By inducing other forms of transformation, the technique has the potential to create super-powerful optical computers. It could potentially help in studying materials by making certain chemical substances temporarily invisible. The applications of the technique are only limited by how well scientists can control the interactions of light and matter.",1,tldr_human

"Travelling with a pet can be a stressful and expensive ordeal, but Delta Air Lines have come up with a way to put passengers at ease when their pet is in the carrier below. The new pet GPS system allows owners to track their furry friends' journeys in real time, from monitoring the temperature below, to whether their cage is upright or askew. The first-of-its-kind technology was developed by Sendum Wireless Corp. and is available for 50 per flight from 10 US airports. Delta's new pet GPS, available for 50 per flight, allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website . The move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights, as Delta Air Lines has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board. Tragically between 2010 and 2013, Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year. They maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors. The service is available from 10 US airlines including Los Angeles and Atlanta . Two months ago it was reportedthat Delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight, and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were, when they were asked by customers. The dogs had been competing at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show in New York and were headed for Seattle. Angry passengers disembarked and were givena free overnight stay at a hotel near JFK, a refund of their 200 dog fees, VIP service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to Seattle. It is hoped the Sendum Wireless Corp. technology, which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold, will give owners peace of mind during their travels. Owners of pets at theWestminster Dog Show in New York were told their pets were not on board their Delta flight, and disembarked to go and find them . The pets were safely retrieved, but the airlines has had a number of animal related incidents in the past .",1,cnn_human

"dusts off pharmaceutical patent essay from last year in college A patent is a legal instrument which gives you the exclusive right to manufacture and sell something for a certain length of time. In order to get filed a patent has to show'inventiveness' (you've invented something new) and originality (it can't have been invented by someone else previously). The patent gives you a'negative right' - you have no obligation to make or sell your product, but you can force other people to not sell it (or to charge a fee for selling it). Say you invent the nail clipper. Before, everybody has been biting their nails, there has been no way to cut fingernails before. You could patent: A hinged metal cutting device [like this] (URL0) '. A hinged metal cutting device for the purpose of removing fingernails'. You can patent devices and methodsprocesses, but not ideas. As far as I'm aware the line between a method and an idea can be very blurry. There are different levels of patents. The first patent would stop anyone from manufacturing and selling nail clippers. It is the stronger of the two patents, because you have complete control over the invention. The second patent does not stop people from selling nail clippers, only from selling clippers for the purpose of clipping nails. A competitor could sell their own version of the nail clippers, but only if they said on the packet'not for fingernails! Only use on (X) '. Patents usually last for 20 years or so, from the date of filing. This is important in medicine and pharmaceuticals because you have to patent an invention before it is submitted to the FDA for approval. Since this approval can take many years you might have only a short space of time to sell your device. After the patent has expired anybody could make your device and sell it at whatever price they like. There are also jurisdictional issues: patents have to be filed separately in the US, the EU, Japan, and the rest of the world. If you have only filed a patent in the US a competitor could sell your device in the EU. Before a patent is filed the invention must be kept secret, but after it's filed you must make all the details of the invention public.,"" ""Patents usually have a lifetime of 20 years. So if you had a patent for something, only you have the right to produce and sell it in that period. As soon as your patent wears out, anyone else can begin producing the exact same item.

"The researchers have examined ocean sediments laid down during the so-called Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum - a dramatic warming event some 56 million years ago. They find the amount of CO2 going into the air at its onset was four billion tonnes a year at most. Today's figure is 10 times as big. The work is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The PETM has been extensively studied by scientists because it is regarded as a possible ""analogue"" for what is happening on Earth now. But the team argues that the scale of human-produced carbon emissions means that the lessons we could learn from the ancient event may actually have limited relevance. ""We have effectively entered an era of a no-analogue state, which represents a fundamental challenge to constraining future climate projections,"" they write in their paper. The PETM was an extraordinary occurrence in Earth history. Previous research has shown that ocean surface temperatures rose by about five degrees in a relatively short timescale, in the geological sense. This phase of global warming drove a rapid turnover in species, both in the sea and on land. CO2 concentration in the atmosphere very probably went above 1,000 parts per million by volume, compared with the 400ppm it stands at today. The big pulse in emissions has been attributed to a range of factors, including a comet impact and prodigious volcanism. Some scientists suspect buried methane stores on the ocean floor were also released, amplifying the warming. In their paper, Richard Zeebe and colleagues do not concern themselves with the cause; what they wanted to pin down was simply the rate of emissions. The team achieved this by studying the remains of tiny marine organisms from the PETM known as Foraminifera. The different types, or isotopes, of carbon and oxygen atoms in these fossils can be used to reconstruct likely CO2 levels and temperature 56 million years ago. Analysis of this chemistry, together with some modelling work, suggests that temperature during the PETM rose in lock-step with carbon emissions. Contrast this with the modern era where carbon emissions are rising so fast the ""equilibrium temperature"" lags behind. Zeebe and colleagues calculate that it took at least 4,000 years for the PETM warming to take hold, with carbon going into the atmosphere at a rate of between 0.6 to 1.1 billion tonnes of carbon per annum. At present, human emissions of CO2 are approaching 40 billion tonnes a year. ""If you go back to the [impactor] that killed off the dinosaurs (66 million years ago) - that was obviously an incredibly quick climate change,"" observed co-author Andy Ridgwell from Bristol University, UK. ""It wasn't driven by carbon emissions per se, but it was still an incredibly quick climate change. And so there has been a lot of searching around for what was the next most rapid event, and people have latched on to the PETM because it has all the characteristics of current warming and anthropogenic emissions - except it turns out the emissions in the PETM were actually an order of magnitude slower than they are today,"" he told BBC News. Just how fast the planet might warm over the next two centuries is a topic of live debate because this likely be a big factor in how well species are able to adapt to changing conditions. ""The rate of change is as important as the magnitude of an event for determining particularly terrestrial ecosystem disruptions,"" Prof Ridgwell said. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",1,xsum_human
"This paper studies directed exploration for reinforcement learning agents by tracking uncertainty about the value of each available action. We identify two sources of uncertainty that are relevant for exploration. The first originates from limited data (parametric uncertainty), while the second originates from the distribution of the returns (return uncertainty). We identify methods to learn these distributions with deep neural networks, where we estimate parametric uncertainty with Bayesian drop-out, while return uncertainty is propagated through the Bellman equation as a Gaussian distribution. Then, we identify that both can be jointly estimated in one network, which we call the Double Uncertain Value Network. The policy is directly derived from the learned distributions based on Thompson sampling. Experimental results show that both types of uncertainty may vastly improve learning in domains with a strong exploration challenge.",1,sci_gen_human

It didn't have any windows either because all the machinery used for wood processing was demolished after the company left. The rest of the building still exists however; the only thing there now is a few giant stacks of paper and a very large machine with lights on top called ""The Wrecker.""

"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a fully-unlabeled target domain. To tackle this task, recent approaches resort to discriminative domain transfer in virtue of pseudo-labels to enforce the class-level distribution alignment across the source and target domains. These methods, however, are vulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving cross-domain category consistency, as the pseudo-labeling accuracy is not guaranteed explicitly. In this paper, we propose the Progressive Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) to align the discriminative features across domains progressively and effectively, via exploiting the intra-class variation in the target domain. To be specific, we first develop an Easy-to-Hard Transfer Strategy (EHTS) and an Adaptive Prototype Alignment (APA) step to train our model iteratively and alternatively. Moreover, upon observing that a good domain adaptation usually requires a non-saturated source classifier, we consider a simple yet efficient way to retard the convergence speed of the source classification loss by further involving a temperature variate into the soft-max function. The extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed PFAN exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on three UDA datasets.",1,sci_gen_human
"We consider a wireless distributed computing system, in which multiple mobile users, connected wirelessly through an access point, collaborate to perform a computation task. In particular, users communicate with each other via radio signals exchanged between their user terminals and the AP.

Obesity prevention strategies have drawn widespread interest because they are expected to decrease excess body fat content potentially leading to lower production and consumption of cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure and diabetes mellitus type 2 induced complications including cardiovascular diseases. It implies therefore that there exists insufficient knowledge concerning factors affecting adherence to dietary interventions aimed toward promoting lean mass retention especially those who belong obese group. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing effects of two intervention groups namely control diet plus exercise set against reduced calories diet aerobic training program aiming reduction of total energy intake ( daily caloric deficit 1000 kcal per week significantly higher than 30.

"For background, I definitely consider myself someone who's had to struggle with social awkwardness. I've managed to improve my social skills from what they were in middle and high school, and feel like I've at least gotten to the point where most people find me likable. However, I still feel that I run into the same difficulties that social awkward people face. Furthermore, I've met and seen plenty of people who appeared to struggle with social skills, and have noticed very common themes in how others treat them. Socially awkward people will find it more difficult to gain and keep more than a small amount of friends, if that. They will most likely find it more difficult to find a job and be successful after school. Most of the superficial qualities that employers value are those that an awkward person would be unlikely to possess. Many socially awkward people are sexually frustrated, and find it almost impossible to find a romantic partner. In my experience, if you're socially awkward, people completely dismiss you. You're basically not a person, just a walking joke. People think its acceptable to openly snicker at every small mistake you make, and make you the butt of every joke. People don't even seem to find it necessary to give you basic respect, or even respect your intelligence enough to at least try to hide their scorn. Jokes about other disadvantaged groups are considered completely taboo. But no one bats an eye at shitting on people who lack social skills. Even supposedly enlightened people will seem to feel no guilt about openly bashing a socially awkward person. The treatment of socially awkward people often lapses into bullying that be considered much less acceptable if it was based on gender or race. The justification that people often give for the scorn socially awkward people receive is that ""they could try to be less awkward."" In my experience however, most socially awkward people are aware of how they come off to other people, and desperately want to be more sociable. It's just too difficult to change the way they interact with people without years of practice and struggle, if that even fully helps. Much of one's personality is outside of one's control, and ostracizing someone for being socially awkward is basically discriminating against someone for personality flaws largely outside of their control.

There are only four endings for every major part. But a lot of people think that those special endings are something unique and rare but you can get them easily by getting the three-disc set of the original edition with all the twelve different levels.

"It's pretty well accepted that the rise of tablets like the iPad are what led to the decline of netbooks. Netbooks were super cheap, but often very slow and shitty. Tablets quickly took over because they were more premium and much easier to use than the early netbooks. However, I believe that ultrabooks will completely take over the tablet space. Since Windows 8, ultrabooks (especially the convertible kinds) have been improving very rapidly. I'm typing this on one such ultrabook, the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro, which I admit is a little too bulky to use regularly like a tablet, but its successor and competitors like the [Dell XPS 13] are going to kill the tablet space. As more and more ultrabooks are being produced, there will be cheaper models that consumers can get, which I feel will offset the fact that most high-end ultrabooks cost a lot more than regular tablets. My Y2P cost me 500, and is far better than the iPad or Android tablets, at least in my experience. As ultrabooks advance with more and more compact form-factors, I think it will lead to the rapid decline of the tablet market, just as tablets killed off the netbook. CMV. Hello, users of CMV!

"If you assume that there's an all-powerful God, then there's no ""technical"" reason why it couldn't have been designed that way. That's sort of how, for example, the Catholic Church sees things. They accept that evolution is real and that humans are a result of billions of years of natural selection. But they also say that humans have a little something extra, the soul, that is given by God. Some branches of Christianity are strict bible literalists, and since Genesis says that the universe, including humans, was created in 6 days, then that doesn't leave any room for something as slow as evolution.','Most creationists accept evolution as fact. A lot of scientists are religious and of the idea that a deity set the ball rolling and evolution is something that naturally occurred based on the world that deity created. The people who have trouble with it are a relatively small but vocal group called ""Young Earthers"" because they believe the Earth was created between six and twelve thousand years ago based on a strict interpretation of the Bible. If the Earth was only a few thousand years old, then there wouldn't be enough time for evolution to occur on a large enough scale to explain the diversity we see today.', ""Strictly speaking there is no reason this can't be the case. I know several religious people who believe this.,It can. There are some people who basically have just relabeled Creationism into Intelligent Design. For them, evolution can't be reconciled with their beliefs. There are many others who believe that evolution is part of God's design. Specifically, where evolution sees random chance in the mutations, these people see the hand of a divine power. To me, this is a more pure representation of what ""Intelligent Design"" should mean.', ""it's not that it can't be; it's simply that evolution doesn't require an intelligent designer in order to occur, there's no evidence for an intelligent designer, and therefore no reason to assume that evolution was caused by intelligent design.,I don't understand this either. It totally can. I was raised Christian and when evolution was explained to me, my child's mind immediately assumed that evolution was guided by God. Why can't adults handle knowing that like, maybe ""The Garden of Eden"" is a metaphorical fable told by Jesus? (I don't know that I believe that anymore) Is the the bible so shakey that if a single piece isn't interpreted literally your whole faith will crumble? Yeah, idk what the fighting is about. Evolution doesn't disprove God. And if Christians accept evolution, but just want to believe God did it whats the big deal? Why is this a Christian vs Atheist issue?', ""while many factors of evolution are set, ex. pressures, the genetic mutations are random, so it is possible that some sort of god affects them, however one must understand that evolution itself isn't goal oriented and is very random.

"Few-shot classification is the task of predicting the category of an example from few labeled examples. The number of labeled examples per category is called the number of shots (or shot number). Recent works tackle this task through meta-learning, where a meta-learner extracts information from observed tasks during meta-training to quickly adapt to new tasks during meta-testing. In this formulation, the number of shots exploited during meta-training has an impact on the recognition performance at meta-test time. Generally, the shot number used in meta-training should match the one used in meta-testing to obtain the best performance. We introduce a theoretical analysis of the impact of the shot number on Prototypical Networks, a state-of-the-art few-shot classification method. From our analysis, we propose a simple method that is robust to the choice of shot number used during meta-training, which is a crucial hyperparameter.

"Recent advancements in eye tracking technology are driving the adoption of gaze-assisted interaction as a rich and accessible human-computer interaction paradigm. Gaze-assisted interaction serves as a contextual, non-invasive, and explicit control method for users without disabilities; for users with motor or speech impairments, text entry by gaze serves as the primary means of communication. Despite significant advantages, gaze-assisted interaction is still not widely accepted because of its inherent limitations: 1) Midas touch, 2) low accuracy for mouse-like interactions, 3) need for repeated calibration, 4) visual fatigue with prolonged usage, 5) lower gaze typing speed, and so on. This dissertation research proposes a gaze-assisted, multimodal, interaction paradigm, and related frameworks and their applications that effectively enable gaze-assisted interactions while addressing many of the current limitations.

"In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed and their hostage freed. In Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died. Here is what we know about the attackers so far. Two brothers accused of carrying out the massacre at the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday were killed two days later when police stormed the building where they had been holding a hostage. Two men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris. Cherif, 32, was jailed in 2008 and had long been known to police for militant Islamist activities, prior to the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, which killed 12 people. Cherif, who also went by the name Abu Issen, had been part of the ""Buttes-Chaumont network"" that helped send would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-UK invasion in 2003. He grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes, where he trained as a fitness coach. In the early 2000s, he joined his elder brother at his home near Paris and worked as a pizza delivery man, media say. Police detained him in 2005 just as he was about to board a plane for Syria - at the time the gateway for jihadists hoping to fight US troops in Iraq. Le Monde reports that, following Cherif's imprisonment between January 2005 and October 2006, he first came into contact with the man who would become his mentor - Djamel Beghal. Beghal was sentenced to 10 years in prison in France in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. In 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended. Eric Bade, a neighbour living in Genneviliers, north-west of Paris, described Cherif as ""well-behaved, friendly, polite, clean-looking and above all, which is very important, he was willing to help old and disabled people."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bade said Cherif ""wasn't aggressive - he wasn't a crazy zealot, he was a calm person."" 'Iraq connections' The brothers had allegedly attended a mosque near the Buttes-Chaumont, an area of northern Paris, where they came under the influence of a radical imam called Farid Benyettou. He reportedly encouraged them to study Islam at his home and at a Muslim centre in their area. A key figure in the Buttes-Chaumont network was Boubaker al-Hakim, a militant linked to al-Qaeda resistance against US forces in Iraq, a French expert on Islamists says. A French court jailed Hakim for seven years in 2008, at the same time as Cherif, along with Farid Benyettou, who got six years. That action broke up the jihadist network they had created. In a blog article (in French) Middle East expert Jean-Pierre Filiu says Hakim had recruited militants to fight in Falluja, an Iraqi city that became an al-Qaeda stronghold in 2004. Hakim is also wanted in Tunisia over the murder of two Tunisian left-wing opposition politicians in 2013 - Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi. Hakim claimed the murder in the name of the Islamic State militant group, Mr Filiu says. In 2010 Cherif Kouachi was named in connection with a plot to spring another Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, from jail - a plot hatched by Beghal, according to French anti-terror police. Belkacem used to be in the outlawed Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and was jailed for life in 2002 for a Paris metro station bombing in 1995 which injured 30 people. Said Kouachi, 34, was also named in the Belkacem plot, but the brothers were not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. Said's ID card was found in the brothers' getaway car which they abandoned after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, police sources say. The gunman who is thought to have killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris has been identified as 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly. Police also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital on Thursday. Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers. Born in Juvisy-sur-Orge on the outskirts of Paris, he is said to have been one of 10 children. He worked for Coca Cola. He met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in 2009, as part of an employment initiative. In an interview with Le Parisien at the time, he said it would be ""impressive"" to meet Mr Sarkozy, and that he was not sure what he would say. He had added that his temporary job at the local Coca Cola plant would be over soon, and that he hoped Mr Sarkozy could help him get a job. Reports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal. In 2013 he was jailed for five years for his involvement in the 2010 plot to free Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from prison, following the militant Islamist's conviction over the 1995 Paris metro station bombing. He met Cherif Kouachi while in prison. Coulibaly was released last year. He is said to have told police from the supermarket on Friday: ""You know who I am."" An acquaintance told AP news agency that he was ""totally shocked"" when he found out about Coulibaly's role in the attacks. ""He never went to prayers or talked about Islam,"" the fellow drug dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Coulibaly's mother and sister have issued a statement condemning his attacks. They offered ""sincere condolences"" to the families of the victims, and said: ""We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion."" Meanwhile, police are still trying to trace Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman who was Coulibaly's partner. She is thought to have married Coulibaly in a religious ceremony in 2009 - however, these ceremonies are not recognised in France unless an official civil ceremony is also carried out. She is now believed to be in Syria. She arrived in Turkey in early January, before crossing into Syria on 8 January, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on 12 January. Police had previously identified her as a suspect in Thursday's shooting of a policewoman. Francois Molins, the chief prosecutor in France, said Boumeddiene had exchanged more than 500 phone calls with the wife of Cherif Kouachi in 2014. French newspaper Le Monde published a series of photographs said to show Coulibaly with Boumeddiene in 2010. In one, she is pictured pointing a crossbow at the camera while wearing a full-face veil, which is banned in France. Police questioned Boumeddiene about Coulibaly in 2010. During the interview, she was reportedly asked about her reaction to attacks by al-Qaeda, and responded: ""I don't have any opinion,"" before blaming the US for civilian deaths. Who is Hayat Boumeddiene?",1,xsum_human

"Prince Louis de Conde, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,[citation needed] arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrucken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604. The Count supported religious reform and wanted the refugees on his lands to maintain their own religion and culture. The community they established was granted concessions and Louis de Conde became the political and military leader of the town.[citation needed] In 1606, the town had grown to 300 inhabitants. A year later the town was under attack from soldiers of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria. As a result of the battle, the town was nearly destroyed and only 60 inhabitants remained. The town was rebuilt and expanded due to the influx of Huguenots from Lorraine, Metz, and Berwick, as well as German Protestants from the Electorate of the Palatinate and the Archbishopric of Trier. The inhabitants of the town paid homage to their savior by adding the French fleur-de-lis to the coat of arms of their town.[citation needed] During the Nine Years' War in 1689, the town was attacked by troops from Trier, but the town managed to successfully defend itself. The town of Friedrichsthal was established in 1748 and began to grow. The town became industrialized in the 19th century. The region around Friedrichsthal was occupied by France during the War of the First Coalition in 1793, but was returned to Prussia in 1815. The town was again occupied by France in 1870. Following the Treaty of Frankfurt, France ceded the town to Germany in 1871, and it became part of the German Empire.[citation needed] Following World War I, the Treaty of Versailles transferred the town to the League of Nations mandate of the Saar. The region was under French control from 1920 to 1935. As a result of a 1933 plebiscite, the region became a part of Nazi Germany in 1935. The town was liberated by American troops in 1945, following World War II. The region was placed under French military control in 1947, and was governed by the Saarland from 1947 to 1956. Following a plebiscite in 1955, the region rejoined West Germany as a state in 1957.[citation needed]",0,squad_machine_continuation_30B

"Person1: Good morning, thanks for coming. Shall we begin? Why do you want to be a music teacher? Person2: Because I've been always loving music since I was young. And I hope I could have a job that suits my interest. Person1: Do you have a degree in related fields? Person2: Yes, I have a bachelor and a master degree in music and art. Person1: Oh, that's very impressive. What kind of music do you like listening to? Person2: I like many kinds of music. Sometimes I listen to the music that has fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. And I love classical music the most. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work. Person1: How do you know about classical music? Person1: Actually, I specialized in classical music for my master study. Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Researches suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character. Person2: Good, I am pretty satisfied with your background. Do you think students should listen to more classical music than others and why? Person1: Yes. Sometimes students can be stressful. Listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework. Person2: Okay, I think I've known enough of you. The interview is over. Person1: Thank you for your time. Person2: Oh, by the way. I think I may want to listen to some classical music. Do you have any suggestions? Person1: You can find plenty of recording on the internet. You can search and listen to different classical music and see which interests you the most. You can also buy them very cheaply online if you like them. Person2: That's a good idea. I'll try it.",1,dialogsum_human

"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in vehicles for applications such as adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11ad-based radar for long-range radar (LRR) applications at the 60 GHz unlicensed band. We exploit the preamble of a single-carrier (SC) physical layer (PHY) frame, which consists of Golay complementary sequences with good correlation properties, as a radar waveform. This system enables a joint waveform for automotive radar and a potential mmWave vehicular communication system based on IEEE 802.11ad, allowing hardware reuse. To formulate an integrated framework of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and LRR based on a mmWave consumer wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, we make typical assumptions for LRR applications and incorporate the full duplex radar assumption due to the possibility of sufficient isolation and self-interference cancellation. We develop single- and multi-frame radar receiver algorithms for target detection as well as range and velocity estimation within a coherent processing interval. Our proposed radar processing algorithms leverage channel estimation and time-frequency synchronization techniques used in a conventional IEEE 802.11ad receiver with minimal modifications. Analysis and simulations show that in a single target scenario, a Gbps data rate is achieved simultaneously with cm-level range accuracy and cms-level velocity accuracy. The target vehicle is detected with a high probability of detection ( 99.9) at a low false alarm of 10 - 6 for an equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 43 dBm up to a vehicle separation distance of 200 m.",1,sci_gen_human
"They came in a rigid-hulled inflatable boat painted yellow and green, its flashing blue lights alien against the sunset I'd grown used to. There were two men on the deck. One of them shouted something as they anchored the boat, but it was too muffled and distant for me to hear. I sat on the beach and waited as they waded in. The man leading - taller, slightly thicker set than the other - knew my name. "" Mr Allen. Can you hear me? "" A voice that didn't belong to me. Didn't belong to the jungle. My breathing quickened and dug my fingers into the sand. An emotion I couldn't place bubbled in my stomach. They were still looking after all these years; they had come to rescue me. I'd dreamt of this moment, but now that it was happening it didn't feel real. "" I'm here to help you. We both are. Your family have been terribly worried these past few days, "" he said. Fresh worry must mean something's wrong. The bubbles in my stomach popped and sent words floating up through my throat. "" The last few days? Is everything okay? "" The man curled one side of his mouth up into a smile and tilted his head. He looked at me as if I were a child asking something charmingly naive. "" We thought we'd lost you, Percy. May I call you Percy? "" I nodded, not caring what he called me as long as he told me whether my family were safe and well. He continued, but didn't answer: "" Thankfully this whole operation has been a success. You'll be back at home with your family soon. "" "" But what's happened in the last few days? Lulu... I suppose she's Lucy now. Is Lucy well? Please tell me nothing's happened to her. "" The man smiled, this time with his whole mouth. "" Lucy is fine, but she's missed her Daddy. "" I closed my eyes and exhaled; somewhere inside me one knot untangled and another tightened. "" I've missed her too, "" I said. Every day it had pained me not to be there for her, to be trapped here without her. "" I understand, Mr Allen, "" said the man, reading my mind. "" At that age a few days apart can feel like a lifetime. Blink and your toddler becomes a teenager. Blink again and you're giving her away on her wedding day. You'll be able to see her once you've been examined. "" The second man stepped forward, indicating that whatever examination they intended was about to take place. I wasn't ready yet, and I wanted to know more before I left this place with them. "" How did you find me? "" The first man, the speaker, seemed puzzled but understood the question. He thought for a moment before answering. "" You were brought here. We've been keeping a close eye on you. "" Though weak from diet and solitude, I exploded, leapt to my feet and burst backwards, away from the men. Were these men my captors, rather than my saviours? Physically, I was no match for them and they quickly closed in on me, one either side, and brought me back to a sitting position, arms clamped to my side and to the sand. I struggled, but only briefly. "" Mr Allen, I'm going to need you to calm down. Breathe. There, that's good. I'll explain everything, but I don't want to overwhelm you. You've been through a very difficult situation. I don't want you to worry, and I need you to trust me when I say that we are here to help you. It's very reassuring that you seem to be in a good physical state though. "" The last sentence seemed to be directed more towards the second man than to me, as if they had been considering my physical health before they arrived. "" If you can manage it, would you be able to come with me and Bernard? "" I didn't say anything, but allowed them to lead me out to sea to their boat, at least one hand on my shoulder the whole time. The sea sloshed about our legs, mine bare, cool in the dying sunlight. When we reached the boat, the first man climbed aboard and helped me up. I was led inside, into a small room with a thin foamy bed and two chairs. The walls were filled with maritime paraphernalia and a small window next to the bed. Bernard, still silent, motioned for me to take the bed. As I passed the window I saw a third man, younger than us all, staring at me with a wild, unsettling stare. I felt a strong reluctance to ask about this man. Once I was on the bed, the first man came and sat by me, a smile once again on his face. He spoke in a soft, rehearsed tone. "" Now I'm just going to ask you a few simple questions. If you don't know any of the answers that's fine, but I'm going to need you to try your best. Bernard will note down a few things as we go along, "" he motioned to the second man, who now held a clipboard and pen, "" but there's no need to worry. It's standard procedure for cases like this. "" I grunted some kind of assent. "" We'll start off with an easy one. Can you tell me your name? "" "" Percy Allen, "" I said, mumbled and perfunctory. "" Thank you Percy. Now tell me about your family. "" He knew which buttons to press. "" I have a wife, Rebecca, and a daughter, Lucy. "" "" How did you and Rebecca meet? "" "" We met at university; my second year, her first. We've been, or at least had been, together ever since. I wouldn't blame her if she's remarried. All I've ever wanted is for her to be happy. "" I'd opened up more than I had meant to. I still didn't trust these men. "" Very good, thank you. Do you remember Lucy's date of birth? "" It was easier to remain uninvolved when the questions were factual. "" Fifteenth of January, "" I said coolly. He looked at me expectantly, still smiling, as though my answer was incomplete, so I gave him the year as well: "" 2011. "" "" Excellent - we often use that question to identify good fathers as well as sound minds. And how about the current year. Would you be able to tell me that? "" "" Well... I expect it must be 2023. Or 2024. It was difficult to keep count of the days after a while. It was all I could do just to stay sane. "" The man and Bernard looked at each other, and Bernard scribbled something onto his clipboard. Something was wrong. Maybe I'd lost count; maybe it was even later. The man's eyes shifted around the room as he thought, and then returned to meet mine. "" Mr Allen, Percy, do you know where you are? "" He'd changed the subject, but I let my guard down completely and suddenly became conversational with my possible-captors. Thoughts I'd been turning over in my head for a long time came pouring out all at once. "" It's something I've wondered for years, you see, as I went off course somewhere in the channel but the storm caught me by surprise and I've not been able to figure out how far north I drifted, and although I've tried to identify lots of the flora and fauna here it's really not been enough information to pinpoint exactly where the island is in the - "" "" Island? "" Lines in the man's brow had deepened, and Bernard was now writing continuously. "" The island. That big sandy thing you just picked me up from. "" The man's confusion softened, but his concern remained. "" Mr Allen, look around you. "" I looked around. The room still had the bed and two chairs that I'd initially seen, but there was a permanence about the place that I hadn't fully appreciated before. I noticed some machinery and an IV stand on the other side of the room that I'm sure hadn't been there when we came in. The window I'd walked past showed only a reflection of the room. "" I..... I don't understand..... "" "" You're in the hospital. Your boating accident left you with some bleeding on the brain. We had to operate, and you seem to be doing remarkably well. "" The air was filled with panic, and I was breathing it in faster and faster. I couldn't be in hospital. I couldn't. "" But... why have you... I've been here all these years? "" "" Mr Allen, today's date is written just over there on the whiteboard next to the door. "" It was the fifth of February, 2017, and I'd crashed my boat three days ago.",1,wp_human
"The recently released bodycam video shows an officer shooting and killing a man who had a previous record of mental illness, after the man aimed a gun at him. On April 11, officer Brian Barnett was confronted by 66-year-old Donald Allen who was captured in a video pointing a loaded 22-caliber pistol towards him. Barnett, who is 25 years old, proceeds to fatally shoot Allen after he approaches him with a firearm while issuing threatening remarks. Please be advised that the content is disturbing. This week, the public was provided with body camera video showing an Oklahoma police officer shooting and killing a man in Sand Springs. Officer Brian Barnett, 25, was recorded on bodycam footage with Donald Allen, 66, aiming a loaded, 22-caliber gun at him. It was believed that the recording was lost due to an issue with the malfunctioning camera. The item was found, but the sound recording was still missing. According to Tulsa World, the video was shown at a news conference on Tuesday by Mike Carter, who is the Deputy Chief of Police. Initially, it was assumed that the video was lost due to a malfunctioning camera. Fox 23 reported that while the forensic analysis was able to retrieve it, the audio from the bodycam was not recovered. Carter stated that we have to make choices that are not usually encountered by others. On that day, that officer was faced with the task of making one of those critical decisions. I think this video makes it quite evident that he made a wise choice. He took the necessary decision. Never mistake that for a choice we wish to make. According to him, he thinks that the shooting was justifiable. Barnett fired his weapon on four occasions. For the last seven years, officers in Sand Springs have been using bodycams, and the recent shooting involving an officer was the first of its kind in the town in 17 years. According to News on 6, police were called while Allen, who was a Vietnam veteran, was firing a gun in his backyard. According to his wife, he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had not taken his medication for one year, as per her statement to the police. The statement made by Deputy Chief Carter was that Mr. Allen is someone who has suffered some harm or injury. He suffers from a mental illness and is also impacted by the flaws in the current system. The occurrence was a sorrowful event. We hope that we never have to experience that situation again. The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office has received all the recordings. Barnett is still not actively working and is waiting for an inquiry from the district attorney of Tulsa County. Deputy chief Mike Carter expressed the hope that they never have to face a similar situation again.",0,cnn_human_para
"I'm a girl. I have a little sister. I have babysat and hung out with many other girls my entire life.

And if they did, it wasn't what lead them to have self-esteem problems later on in life.

At that age, few girls really care about weight, beauty, etc. in the way that ""big girls"" and women do. They just want to find a cute outfit for Barbie's next fun day out with Ken and her friends. While I'm sure there are stories of girls being influenced by Barbie's appearance, I can assure you that they are few and far between.

"Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found. A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment. But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015. There is a survival rate of up to 90 when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30 if it is discovered in the later stages. Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed. There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either. Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer. However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy. Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours. The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average. Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage. Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: ""Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives."" She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: ""There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths."" Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: ""Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK, this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible. ""In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results."" Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that. ""Early detection of ovarian cancer will be the key to transforming survival rates. However, this study is very small, and there is no guarantee that the results will be replicated on a larger scale.""",1,xsum_human

"US prosecutors had been expressing their wish to put him on trial in a US court since his arrest in February 2014. Guzman, who was named Public Enemy Number One by the Chicago Crime Commission in 2013, has been indicted by at least seven federal district courts. As the head of the Sinaloa cartel, he is accused of overseeing the smuggling of huge amounts of drugs from South and Central America to the United States. He is also facing charges of money laundering, racketeering and arms trafficking in courts as far apart as Arizona and Texas. But since his 2014 arrest in his home state of Sinaloa, Mexico, there has been little movement on the extradition front. While US courts were arguing about who had the best case against Guzman and should therefore get priority putting him on trial, Mexican officials were making it clear they were in no rush to send him across the border. Mexico's attorney general at the time, Jesus Murillo Karam, said as early as April last year that he had ""no intention"" of handing Guzman over to the US authorities. In an interview with Mexican daily El Universal, Mr Murillo Karam said he was annoyed at a plea bargain an extradited Mexican drug dealer had struck with the US authorities. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, also known as Vicentillo, pleaded guilty in a court in Chicago to smuggling tonnes of cocaine and heroin to the United States. In exchange for promising the US authorities ""full and truthful co-operation,"" his sentence was reduced from a potential life sentence to 10 years. The US authorities believed Vicentillo could prove a key witness if Joaquin Guzman was ever extradited to the United States. The son of Guzman's number two, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, and a key player in the drugs trade himself, Vicentillo was seen as a valuable asset. But Mr Murillo Karam said he felt ""uncomfortable"" with the deals the US reached with ""criminals"" such as Vicentillo. The then-attorney general pointed out that there were plenty of charges Guzman faced in Mexico as well as in the US and that he wanted to see him tried in his homeland. He reiterated his position in January of this year, when he again stated that he wanted to see Guzman serve his sentence in Mexico first. 'El Chapo [Guzman] has to stay here to serve his sentence and then I'll extradite him. That could be in about 300 to 400 years, there's still a long time to go."" At the time, he said that he thought a formal extradition request by the US was imminent, but it seems that following Mr Murillo Karam's strong words, the request was not filed. He argued that keeping Guzman in Mexico was also a question of sovereignty. But Mr Murillo Karam is more likely to regret another statement he made back in January. He said that extradition should be considered in instances where there was a flight risk, something he said did ""not exist"" in the case of Guzman. Given the fact the Guzman had escaped from another top security jail in 2001 and was on the run for the next 13 years, this was a surprising assurance. Comparisons have been drawn between Joaquin Guzman and the late infamous Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar. Both made immense fortunes in the illicit drug trafficking trade, and through bribery and intimidation managed to sway huge power and infiltrate parts of the security forces. Both have also mounted successful and spectacular escapes from jail. It was Pablo Escobar's jail break that played a major part in changing the Colombian approach to extradition. In a 1991 deal with the Colombian authorities, Escobar agreed to hand himself in to the Colombian police and to serve five years in a jail built to his own specifications in his hometown of Medellin. La Catedral (the cathedral), as the luxury jail was known, boasted a football pitch, a jacuzzi and a bar among its many amenities. After little more than a year, Escobar escaped from the jail and went on the run, much like Guzman did on Saturday. He was eventually killed a year later while still on the run. But before he was jailed, Escobar had threatened and cajoled members of a constitutional assembly to enshrine a ban on extraditions in the Colombian constitution. It remained in force until December 1997, when a constitutional amendment reversed the ban. Since then, Colombia has extradited many drug dealers to the United States saying that it is both a cheaper and safer option for the Colombian justice system. Colombian officials argue that in the US, Colombian drug dealers will find it harder to intimidate guards and their families or to access their riches to bribe prison staff. With 30 prison staff and the warden under questioning over the escape of Chapo Guzman at Mexico's Altiplano jail, this argument may well be met with more open ears in Mexico, too, now.",1,xsum_human

"Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free -for-all auction and not face stiff fines for doing so. The city wants uberX cars (and presumably other taxis) to take the same routes as the yellow cab drivers who have been there all along, but Uber says it shouldn't because of its ""free market advantage."" The New York Post has this story: For decades, city residents used yellow taxi medallions - now called ""taxi medallions"" - to hail rides on city streets... But once Uber arrived in 2015, many drivers switched over to the ride-hailing company from the old fleet of taxicab vehicles without replacing their medallions. In 2017 alone, about 10,000 new medallion owners swapped out their old licenses for Uber blue cards. Some drivers even started offering discounted fares by flashing their yellow card numbers at passengers. And last year, Uber lost 9 million on the value of its medallions after it was hit with penalties, according to city records obtained through an open records request. And the mayor claims he doesn't know how much money Uber actually makes per day off medallion holders. He tells the Post: I don't know where those numbers are coming from or what it means. There's no transparency to anything like that. I just think we need more competition across the board, but you've got to do that responsibly. That's part of why we're trying to get these medallions back up again. You can't give anybody too much power. You can't force people to do something against their interests. They'll always find another way around it. We want them to use our system responsibly."" DeBlasio also seems to be pushing back the date his administration will release its first full report on all the regulatory changes required for Uber to operate here in NY. That won't happen until sometime next month, when Uber plans to start taking applications for new medallion licenses.",0,cmv_machine_continuation_opt_1.3b

The indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect.

"A government drive to encourage participation in rugby in English schools has been met with criticism from public health doctors who warn that the initiative could put children at risk of serious injury. The scheme, launched by the Department for Education, is aimed at increasing the number of children playing rugby in state-funded schools across the country. However, doctors warn that the lack of proper safety measures in these schools could lead to children getting hurt. Rugby is a contact sport that carries a risk of injury, especially to the head and neck. Public health doctors argue that children are particularly vulnerable to these types of injuries, as their bodies are still developing and their necks are not strong enough to withstand the impact of tackles. Without proper safety measures, such as the use of mouthguards and scrum caps, children risk suffering concussions, broken bones, and other serious injuries. The doctors also argue that schools need to invest in training for coaches, so they are better equipped to prevent and respond to injuries. Despite these concerns, the government has pushed ahead with the rugby initiative, arguing that the sport can help children build character and resilience. The Department for Education has also stressed that safety measures are in place in schools to reduce the risk of injury. However, public health doctors argue that these safety measures are not enough and that the government needs to take more action to protect children from injury. They are urging schools to invest in better safety measures and for the government to review its drive to encourage rugby participation. The debate over the safety of rugby in schools is not new, but it highlights the ongoing tension between the health risks associated with contact sports and the potential benefits they can offer children in terms of physical fitness and personal development. As the government continues to promote the benefits of rugby in state schools, it must also take steps to ensure that children are safe and protected from harm. Only then can parents feel confident that their children are participating in a sport that rewards them without placing them at undue risk.",0,xsum_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"Sally was driving down the road when the smelled something funny. She looked everywhere in her car. She could not find anything out of the ordinary. She finally looked on her dashboard and saw her check engine light was on. She realized that she needed to get her car checked out. She took her car to the local auto repair shop. Sally told the mechanic that she smelled something funny and her check engine light was on. She needed to get to work so she told the mechanic that she would pick up her car on her way home from work. The mechanic did an inspection of Sally's car and found that her catalytic converter was the cause of the issue. He replaced the catalytic converter and Sally was back on the road in no time. She had her car for many years and appreciated that she would not have to buy a new car. The mechanic explained that if she had not had the catalytic converter repaired it could have caused her car to not run. Sally was happy that she brought her car in to get repaired. In the United States, a vehicle is considered to be a large source of pollution. Automobile manufacturers have put many features on their cars to keep the pollution down. This is where the catalytic converter comes into play. A catalytic converter reduces the pollutants that a car emits. The catalytic converter takes the harmful gases that a car emits and turns them into less harmful gases. The catalytic converter is found in the exhaust system of a car. The catalytic converter is a honeycomb shaped structure. The gases flow through the honeycomb shaped structure and get cleaned. If the catalytic converter goes bad it will have to be replaced. The catalytic converter can go bad for many reasons. One of the reasons is the car not getting proper maintenance. If the car is not getting proper maintenance there are many parts that will not work properly. The catalytic converter needs the car to be running correctly to work properly. Another reason that the catalytic converter may not work properly is that it has become clogged. This can happen over time as the car is being used. If the catalytic converter becomes clogged it will have to be replaced. There are many signs that a catalytic converter is not working properly. One of the signs is the check engine light coming on. If the check engine light comes on the car will have to be looked at by a mechanic. The catalytic converter can be checked to see if it is the cause of the check engine light. Another sign that the catalytic converter is not working properly is a decrease in fuel economy. If the fuel economy goes down significantly the car should be taken in to be checked. Another sign that the catalytic converter is not working properly is an odd smell coming from the exhaust pipe. If the car smells like rotten eggs it could be a sign that the catalytic converter is not working properly. If the catalytic converter is not working properly it will need to be replaced. A mechanic can diagnose whether or not the catalytic converter needs to be replaced. The mechanic can also replace the catalytic converter. A new catalytic converter can be installed in a car in a short amount of time. A catalytic converter is an important part of a car. It reduces the emissions that a car puts out into the environment. The catalytic converter is also not expensive to replace. If the catalytic converter goes bad it will need to be replaced. Q: Thermostat and radiator cap The cooling system is a closed system.

"This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational.

He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time. It's just sad that the character didn't really change at all. Even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end, she is consumed by worry about her adventure-seeking husband. So 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us (and those are only for the good intentions...)! The problem of Indian suppression is dealt with quite nicely, but there is that patronizing story-telling again.

"I think Game of Thrones is a fantastic TV show, i think the producers are doing the best job possible to bring the books to the TV, but ultimately the ones that are truly going to appreciate it and all that's built into it are book readers. I believe the show has made an effort to explain everything that's going on but have ultimately failed. Here's why: Most show viewers recognize the main characters but have trouble following even the names or the plots of minor characters. It's same for book readers, but repetition of names and styles eventually lets them sink in. Doesn't happen in the show. Most people would still tell you that the good guys are the Starks and Khaleesi, and the bad guys are the Lannisters and Melisandre and aren't quite sure who are the Baratheons, Greyjoys, Martells, or any other family and are trying hard to classify them as good or evil. I think they even hope they don't matter much because they have trouble following their comparably minimal appearances. The reality is that all the families are neither good nor evil. The books put a lot of emphasis on the events that occurred in the past because eventually all of that will have repercussions in the present and future. I think the show has tried to tell the stories of what happened in the near past, but have hardly scratched the surface compared to the richness the books have imbued into these stories. EDIT: I haven't read something that truly can counter this point. Most people tune in for the boobs, the violence and the production value. EDIT: DEFINITELY WRONG ABOUT SAYING MOST, REGARDING THIS BULLET POINT. Even book readers have trouble understanding what's going on.

Alayne stood with her brother at last as Prince Roland bent down beside Robbie Fowler and kissed the boy on both cheeks: ""My brave friend! You have done us all proud today; my sister will be your queen. Thank you so much for coming back from Avalon to fight alongside me. I promise that you shall never regret it. And thank you, Rory, for helping protect our families while we fought. Now go home to them safe and well. They would wish nothing else but this same thing for themselves here tonight. A toast then? To brotherhood between men named Fowler ..."" Roland raised an old flagon high up above their heads, and they drank deeply together even though there wasn't any wine or beer inside the glass. It grew cold again almost instantly, leaving them feeling empty instead, like something vital had been sucked out of them. Slowly she lowered herself next to her husband's body, sobbing quietly against its side, hand resting upon Robbie's shoulder who patted her softly back trying desperately hard not to cry himself...

The internet is so hot that while it might sound like a great idea to get your garage garage cleaned up, you probably aren't doing enough. You'll want to find a new paint job or new carpeting design before getting stuck on your dirt poor back yard! If you're looking for an inexpensive fix for your garage, you can try this handy guide: 1) Use a little bit of time and patience when cutting down your lawnmower blades. If you do the right thing, there's no way anyone will see you cut down anymore of your grass outside their house, even if they have your help! 2) Get some other tools, such as a saw and a drill, to make cutting more difficult and to lessen the amount of work you need for each part of the task. 3) Remember to measure the size and shape of your bottom blade (you may want to use another blade). Make sure that the edges are all proper sized if you don't feel comfortable using them. Again, find a good spot where you can easily cut the wood. 4) Be careful not to overcut yourself by overtaking the garden hose. This could seriously cause damage to your lawn! A small garden hose has long been the standard tool for mulching every single day since it was first introduced in the 1950s, providing the best chance at removing weeds from your outdoor space. 5) Keep eye-out for any potential side effects of mowing indoors. (You could also always go to the vet and get tested.) For many types of mowed lawn mowers, this can be quite costly - they may require a whole lot of maintenance, which means they should be able to maintain reasonable income without much fuss.",0,hswag_machine_continuation_opt_125m

"I've just been reading on immigration issues in the UK and other European countries, and it really scares me how White people are declining in every European country. I believe that non-white immigrants have a dramatically harder time integrating into European society, and end up forming ethnic enclaves rather than assimilating. I believe this weakens the greater society. People prefer to interact with people of their own race, and in the end when White people are less than 50 of the population of Europe there will be a patchwork of different cultures in each nation rather than one unified one. I also believe mass immigration and ethnic minorities permanently changes a nation, and cause huge problems in society such as the recent Rotherham scandals and the Birmingham school scandals, not to mention the issue of halal meats in Subway stores and such.

"A quantum effect called superabsorption allows a collection of molecules to absorb light more efficiently than if each molecule were acting individually. Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a new type of molecular nanocavity that can be tuned by applying external magnetic fields, which opens up the possibility for possible applications in biomedical imaging and optoelectronics devices such as LED lighting or solar cells. In their paper published today (September 26) in Nature Nanotechnology, researchers at UC Santa Barbara describe how they created such a molecular cavity using organic materials known as thiophene derivatives. The scientists made use of an unconventional concept that has been discovered within this system - two layers of dipoles surrounding one another along a single axis - to induce supercavitation. Dipole-dipole excitations are among the best absorbers of electromagnetic radiation with good sensitivity in low wavelengths and high power density, making them useful tools for biological imaging techniques like ultrasound and fluorescent detection. ""This is basically the first study where we show that you can do not only regular exciton absorption but also superexcitons,"" said lead author Dr. Ignacio Camargo, who conducted his postdoctoral research work on this project while working under the supervision of Professors Tsung-Dong Lu and John Rogers at UCSB. ""It was really quite surprising, because it had never before been done in any other system."" Supercavitating dipole-dipole structures have recently attracted significant interest from a wide range of disciplines due to their potential application in optical sensors based on surface plasmons - oscillations between electrons located near the surfaces of many metallic substances - and a variety of optoelectronic devices including LEDs, photodetectors, and lasers. In these systems, the properties of individual dipoles could potentially be manipulated through the physical interaction with electric fields, so that different combinations may produce different types of cavities. The scientists demonstrated that photoluminescence changes of the device could be induced when varying the alignment angle of the dipoles. This could potentially enable precise control over the excitation process, improving efficiency of laser devices. More importantly, the unique combination of dipolar characteristics enables multiple modes of action, enhancing the ability to detect weak signals without sacrificing overall brightness - ideal features needed for future sensors and devices requiring illumination at low intensities.",0,tldr_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b

"It was the screams that woke me up, oddly enough. Many thousands of tons of jell-o suddenly collapsing on top of a small town should be quite loud. I suppose it was the screams that I heard. The first of many. Suddenly, I was awake, sitting upright in my bed, the covers wrapped around my throat. My bedroom was dark. The room I was in was very small, smaller than most of the rooms I had slept in since leaving my parent's home. I had never liked sleeping in my own room. I kept my bedroom light on, hoping to find the comfort that light might provide. I never found it. At the end of my bed was a window, which was open, but I knew I hadn't opened it. The window was large and could be opened by merely placing a hand on the window sill and giving it a push. I was not a small person, and the window would have been unlikely to open without the help of something more than my hand. It did not move when I sat up, so I knew it was not open. Outside my window was a large tree, and I could make out its branches in the light of the full moon that shone into my room. It was a very large tree. I had often thought about climbing it, and when I had been a child, I had actually tried. I had been successful in climbing about four or five feet, and then my muscles had given out, causing me to fall back to the ground. I was convinced that one day, I would make it all the way to the top. Now, with a full moon shining down on the tree, I could see the trunk. It was a wide, full, beautiful tree, full of life. It was a tree that the townspeople in the area had come to admire. It had won awards for its beauty. It was a tree that had been talked about in the newspaper for years. It was a beautiful tree. I looked at the tree, and then I looked to the window. I knew that if I opened the window, I could easily climb down the tree. The window was just a few feet from the tree, and the distance between it and the ground was only about six feet. If I leaned forward just a bit, I could easily drop the six feet to the ground. I knew I would be safe, and I knew I could climb the tree. I also knew that it was the middle of the night, and I was supposed to be in bed. It was not something I could do without consequences. I wanted to, though. I wanted to climb that tree. I wanted to climb that tree very much. I looked at the window, and then I looked at the tree. I looked back at the window, and then back at the tree. I thought about my actions. I thought about my choices. I thought about my consequences. I thought about how badly I wanted to climb that tree. I thought about how safe I knew it would be. I thought about how easy it would be. I thought about all the good things that would come from my actions. I thought about all the good things I could do. I thought about how happy I could be. I thought about the good things I would be able to do after I climbed that tree. I thought about all of the good things I would have to give up if I did not climb that tree. I thought about all the good things I would be able to do if I did not climb that tree. I thought about how much I wanted to climb that tree. I thought about how easy it would be.

"We chose bands based on their size and flexibility. The higher your frequency the more information you can put in it for the most part. The HF (high frequency) band (1.6 to 30mhz) can transmit beyond line of sight due to the way the frequencies in that band interact with the atmosphere. Furthermore, the very low frequencies such as those in the khz range, can travel great distances through water. Each band holds different properties which make it better or worse at certain applications. I work on radios as part of my job. Let me know if I need to clear anything up. I can get into a lot more detail if you like. Edit because I misunderstood your question.','Antenna sizes and shapes are designed to be the most efficient at receiving the transmission, given constraints like weight, size, etc.. By choosing an antenna length (for a dipole antenna, the type that you used to see on roofs to receive TV signals) that is 12 the wavelength of the signal you can achieve a resonance in the antenna. Basically the signal bounces back and forth inside the antenna and constructively interferes with itself, providing maximum signal strength. Radio telescopes like Arecibo are huge for a different reason. They want to precisely locate the source of the radio waves that reach them, and diffraction becomes a limiting factor. The larger the antenna, the less of an issue that diffraction becomes, and the more precisely you can locate things. The size of the bowl is the aperture. You reach a limit on what can be achieved (you can only make antennas so big in a practical sense) which is why modern installations use an array of antennas to create a ""synthetic aperture."" If you link up a bunch of smaller dishes that are precisely located and have suitable distance between them, you can simulate a much larger antenna and achieve very good results. The choice of bands to transmitreceive on depends on a huge number of factors, including the amount of data you are trying to transmit, how clear the frequency band is, what issues you'll face in the environment (the atmosphere, for example) that might interfere with transmission of your signal. There are a ton of different factors that impact transmission you can see a list here) ] (URL0)",1,eli5_human
"Israel made ""substantial efforts"" to avoid civilian deaths, it said. The militant group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, called the Israeli report worthless. It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time. The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. ""This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,"" the report said. ""Harm to the civilian population.... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,"" it added.

Nicholas Lansman, ISPA secretary-general, said: ""It is important that customers look at the full terms of an offer when choosing a provider. ""Ofcom recently concluded that the UK has one of the most competitive broadband markets among major European economies, as the average price of a fixed broadband package has fallen by 40 and speeds have greatly increased."" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said confusing teaser rates and hidden costs made it difficult for consumers to work out whether they were getting a good deal.

""Some broadband firms are starting to accept that prices need to be clearer. Now the whole industry needs to up its game."" The charity said that line rental was the most expensive additional cost. The ISPA said that service providers using the BT network were required to levy a line rental charge, which went toward maintaining the network used by most of the UK for both phone calls and broadband. The report comes as Virgin Media was criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for one of its broadband adverts. Two customers complained that they had signed up to the operator's 12-month broadband contracts only to be told that their monthly charges would be increasing during the minimum term.

"so is hard water H20some other chemicals (e.g. Ions, metals, etc.) Pretty much... Most often it's just dissolved metal salts. There are effectively two measures of hardness: Carbonate hardness (often known as alkalinity), and general hardness. Carbonate hardness is a measure of the presence of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in the water. This has a big effect on the pH buffering capacity of the water. General hardness can be thought of as the measure of the ""other half"" of the salt... Which basically means metal ions... Calcium and magnesium being common ones!",1,eli5_human
"Visiting NC from South Florida, which is closer to NY on the culinary map than the Deep South, we were craving some down-home style southern food. FBC did not disappoint! We had the best southern breakfast of our lives. We brought our family members along for a week and breakfast treats including fresh bread rolls with sausage gravy, eggs benedict and cornbread stuffing made from scratch by Randy's Bread Co., baked potatoes scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy made with whipped cream cheese and fresh pickled veggies. We also enjoyed a delicious homemade dessert called Christmas Cake Salad Cake made with sweet potato lattes and chocolate chip cookies! We loved the pork chops from Store Builders in Deer Park! Tuesday night we headed over to The Garden State for a delicious breakfast buffet at Red Cross Restaurant. We are thankful for this amazing meal being available so soon after the shutdowns began...and these delicious foods sure helped! Wednesday morning we went for a drive in the beautiful Gulf Coast to visit friends near Naples (New Orleans). I am loving these beautiful beaches!! It was so nice to be able to enjoy them again while enjoying our little town!!! Thursday morning we celebrated Mother's Day in LA....the closest we have come since we arrived here in Orlando! We visited several friends who live around here too...happy Mother's Day! We won't forget the holiday! Friday morning we returned home, changed clothes and stayed overnight in Orlando. Friday evening our friends and families gathered together for a fun outdoor supper hosted by our Friends on Sunny Isles Beach. We couldn't stop laughing all day long thinking about the lovely memories we will make together over lunch time Saturday afternoon when we get back into town. We couldn't wait!!! Saturday morning we started to explore our favorite restaurants in Downtown Orlando.....all three restaurants were BBQ places that were open late for dinner! Wishing all our friends San Francisco and Miami were nearby haha!!! Monday morning we spent our day celebrating Mother's day! We took advantage of the free parking lot off Belle Isle Park Avenue for breakfast brunch later in the afternoon. We drove up to Lakeland, FL right before breakfast then enjoyed brunch at New Orleans Cheese Steak House where we sampled our favorite French cuisine. We didn't want to miss any of the other wonderful meals they served! While there we met up with friends and family for lunch at Lemonade Coffee Shop! We really liked the delicious lunch!! This weekend we got to celebrate our mothers birthday in Orlando.......over 100 people attended our wedding reception!!!! Thanks for allowing us to share your reunion with you!!

"Went here for the Weezer concert. The venue is very interesting as it has many pools but you cannot go swimming during the show. We got there early and got the chance to check out the pool and do some of the slides. We had a blast. The location, right on the ocean, is gorgeous. The only reason this is not 5 stars is that the amenities are dated, and the service is not up to par for a place of this price. The beach club needs to be updated, and the beach needs to be cleaned up. We went to see Slightly Stoopid and it was the best show ever. The place was beautiful, the crowd was amazing, and the music was on point. Food is good. Waitress is nice and friendly. Live music is great. It is a little pricey. Overall is a good experience.

This paper presents a method for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors for some types of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The main idea is to approximate the functions involved in the eigenvalue problem by rational functions and then to linearize the resulting problem. A few different schemes are proposed to solve this linear eigenvalue problem. The expanded form of the linear problem is not solved directly but it is exploited instead to extract all eigenvalues in a certain region of the complex plane. A few theoretical results are established to explain why the approach works and a few numerical experiments are described to validate it.,1,sci_gen_human

I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this thread is not specifically about whether it should be changed (I'm already firmly convinced that the current system isn't working). Instead, if you want me and others who also think a new system needs implemented for V4 to discuss how such a thing might work then feel free to start your own topic with whatever informationlinks etc. we can provide!

"As I see it, children come out of school having learned a large number of facts (or not as the case may be) but have very little understanding about the 'why' and 'wherefore' of the world they're in. I am not saying that the facts should not be taught. Far from it - they are important and help these people become useful members of society. However thinking about thinking; contemplating the idea of motivation for action; and similar things are generally completely lacking from modern western education systems. From what I've seen, this leads to a society with a very large number of shallow, self-absorbed people. Many people haven't emotionally developed beyond a very rudimentary idea of gratification and getting what they want. If you look to our history, this has always generally been the case. Historically, we had much more noticeable class systems with the 'elite' and the 'proletariat'. The elite did study philosophy whereas the proles generally did not. While I'm not saying this was a good situation, it did 'work' for society as a whole. In the modern world however, the classes are being broken down. They're not gone, but they're definitely different and weaker than they were before. One very important difference now is that the people who might once have been 'proles' can effect real change in society through equal voting rights. This is a good thing (in my opinion); but as a consequence, it is now more vital to have the widest range of people understanding some of the less tangible aspects of thought - e.g. philosophy - so that their vote isn't controlled by those who have learned how to control them. If people learned philosophy at school, there would be more people able (and willing) to contribute meaningfully to society as a whole, leading to a better life for everyone. CMV...",1,cmv_human
"Knowledge graphs have become a popular formalism for representing entities and their properties using a graph data model, e.g., the Resource Description Framework (RDF). An RDF graph comprises entities of the same type connected to objects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with properties. RDF graphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group of properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and objects. In case the number of these entities or properties in these star patterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and query processing are negatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns . We address the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and devise the concept of factorized RDF graphs , which denote compact representations of RDF graphs where the number of frequent star patterns is minimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent star patterns and generate a factorized RDF graph , where compact RDF molecules replace frequent star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star pattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates the corresponding star pattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent star pattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the frequent star pattern; it is linked to the entities that originally match the frequent star pattern. Since the edges between the entities and the objects in the frequent star pattern are replaced by edges between these entities and the surrogate entity of the compact RDF molecule, the size of the RDF graph is reduced. We evaluate the performance of our factorization techniques on several RDF graph benchmarks and compare with a baseline built on top of gSpan , a state-of-the-art algorithm to detect frequent patterns. The outcomes evidence the efficiency of proposed approach and show that our techniques are able to reduce execution time of the baseline approach in at least three orders of magnitude. Additionally, RDF graph size can be reduced by up to 66.56 while data represented in the original RDF graph is preserved.",1,sci_gen_human

"Reverend Irene Wilson was leaving Holy Trinity Church in Hull at 13:30 BST on 7 August when her vehicle was targeted. Jay Desborough, 17, and Leon Wrigglesworth, 13, both from the city, were each given a 24-month detention and training order in a young offenders institute at the city's youth court. Rev Wilson said it had ""affected myself and the work that I do."" The pair had only known each other for a week before carrying out the carjacking, the court heard. As well as having her car stolen, Rev Wilson's handbag containing PS250 in cash and a laptop computer were also taken. In court, the vicar described how her daughter, who she was speaking to on the phone at the time of the attack, was ""still traumatised from hearing my screams."" Robin Smith, the solicitor defending Desborough, told the court the teenager had asked a family member to send an apology letter and a bouquet of flowers to the vicar as an apology. But Rev Wilson, who was in court, confirmed it had not happened. The vicar said she had ""at all times tried to understand the culprits"" and asked people to ""pray for the two young men, that they will make a positive decision."" Sally Robinson, the Crown Prosecution Service's reviewing lawyer, said: ""This was a shocking attack carried out in broad daylight on a respected community figure. ""Our thoughts remain with Rev Wilson as she continues to recover from the effects of this crime."" Chairman of the bench Vincent Bergin lifted a ban on naming the teenagers. Desborough, who was aged 16 at the time of the attack, admitted to one charge of robbery at a previous hearing. Wrigglesworth denied robbery but was found guilty following a trial. He was also convicted of 15 other offences.",1,xsum_human
"So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, others are important for the whole world. The most importent thing to me right now, is that there is a solid plan for the climate change, and that we can do something about it. A second important thing is the economy and jobs, in which I am also interested because of my Danish background. I think it's hard to come up with a long term goal that you really want to achieve. It's more of a process. I have a lot of small goals, that are all important to me, but I'll do my best to put the most importent of them on the first list. A thing I'd like to start with, is to make the world a better place for future generations, by fighting climate change. We are running out of natural resources. We are running out of nature itself. We need to make a step back, and look at what we are doing to the planet. It's not just about emissions, but also about deforestation, and overfishing. We need to stop using natural resources. We need to look at what we are doing to nature, and how we can make it better. I don't think that we will ever have enough energy to live in a world without nuclear power. It is too important for us. We can just manage it better, so that we get more energy with less waste. We need to look at how we are using energy, and find better ways to produce it. I would like to be a writer. I want to write stories, and I want to write for newspapers. I think it's a nice thing to do. It's important to me.

"I woke up with my arms tied behind my back and my body restrained to an old, rickety wooden chair. The smell of wet moss penetrated my nostrils. ""Hey, Vince! He's waking up!"" Kidnapped again. It was becoming less of a nuisance and more of a minor inconvenience these past few years. ""What the hell do you two idiots want?"" I said. A fire crackled in the background. Our shadows danced against the walls. We were in..... a cave? A bit dramatic, if you ask me. ""Dave, tell us your Reasons. We know how old you are, we know all about ""460 years old. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know how old I am. I've been through this whole spiel more more times than years you've been alive. You think you're the first ones? Ha."" ""Punch him Vinnie,"" Vince said. Vinnie connected his fist with my left eye. It hurt, but only a little more than last time I had gotten punched there. Why are punches the always first resort? They'd probably get more mileage pulling molars or pouring acid on my my face. ""Vince and Vinnie. Is this a joke? Am I on the set of some shitty Italian mobster movie?"" I quipped. I gathered up some mucus and with a strong ""ptui"" I launched the coagulated, pale yellow ball into Vince's eye. He reeled back in pain, furiously trying to wipe the goop away. Vinnie was livid. ""If you don't tell us what your morning prayers are to that prick Death, we'll just leave you here. No one knows this cave exists. No one except us. No one will hear you scream and you'll just be alive down here forever. The rats will naw at your toes and you'll scream, but you won't be able to die. Unless, of course, you choose to. How's that sound?"" Vinnie was smiling, and he seemed so full of himself. I almost burst out into laughter. ""You really want to know my Reasons?"" Vince stopped his eye rubbing. The key to immortality was far more important than his vision. ""I don't have any Reasons. I haven't prayed for over 400 years. I wake up every afternoon at half past two so I miss morning prayer. That's my secret!"" And then Vinnie punched me again, in the right eye this time. ""This was a waste of time. Let's just leave him here,"" Vince told Vinnie. I laughed. ""I didn't want to have to do this, but here we go."" This was a rare occasion. If I didn't call on Death himself, I would actually just be trapped in this cave forever. ""Death!"" I screamed. ""Come down here right now or I'll off myself right now! I swear I'll do it!"" ""The fuck are you doing?"" Vince asked impatiently. ""Death! I know you're listening you asshole, come down here or I'll bite my tongue off and just die right here!"" There was a deafening snapping sound and blinding light. The next thing we saw was a pale skinned figure with wet brown hair, donning a white robe and flip flops. The word ""Death"" was emblazoned in gold on the left chest pocket of his robe. What a narcissist. ""Jesus Christ, Dave, what do you want?"" the figure asked. ""Well I'm kind of trapped here, could you let me out?"" Death snapped and the ropes fell loose. ""You interrupted my shower for this? Damn it, Dave, this is why I sent you back, you annoying piece of shit."" Death turned to Vince and Vinnie. ""What are you two looking at?"" After a moment of shock, Vince responded. ""Why the hell does Dave get special treatment? Every morning we pray to you not to kill us, because no one will feed our wives and kids. Some days we don't even feel like living anymore, but who's gon na take care of the family? Yet, Dave doesn't even go to morning prayer and you come to save him?"" Death laughed dryly, ""Dave died a long time ago. He's the only one I ever sent back to the land of the living. A mere hour of being with him and I wanted to Kurt Cobain myself. But I can't, because I'm the motherfucking god of death."" ""If you're a god, why didn't you just send him away? To the depths of the underworld? All-powerful my ass."" Vince asked. ""Why? Because my fucking niece fell in love with him! It was a match made in hell. And the wedding, oh man, don't even get me started on the wedding! You know, my sister's still mad for sending Dave back, even after 400 fucking years!"" Death was oozing with frustration just remembering about our wedding, and I was relishing in it. Finally, Vince had enough and burst out in fury. ""You know, I don't know why we pray to you. You're not a god! You're just some fat fuck in a robe! Fuck y And before Vince finished, God snapped and both my kidnappers dropped dead. ""Thanks, Death,"" I said, grinning tauntingly. Death cracked a sarcastic smile back. ""Fuck you, Dave.""

"Steve Rogers was sitting on his rocking chair just outside his house. The sun was bright but not too warm, especially with the light breeze. He enjoyed the neighborhood. It had been so long since he and Carol first moved here to this area of Long Island New York that he felt like a new man when compared with back then. He smiled as he remembered how it used to be. Back in Brooklyn where they grew up, it seemed almost impossible for them to survive financially. All their money went toward helping other family members out who were struggling. They barely made enough to pay rent let alone afford food or any type of entertainment. Even though Steve loved being close to all those relatives, many times during his childhood growing up there he would have to go without even having dinner because everything else needed more attention than what they could spare. Now however things were different. Nowadays Steve and Carol managed very well despite both living off minimum wage jobs. Both worked at a local supermarket chain called Foodtown which sold groceries among other items. As far as Steve knew wages weren't supposed to increase much each year but luckily they did due to higher sales from increased customer traffic. With an average salary of 14 per hour now, it allowed him and Carol to live comfortably every month instead of using most of their earnings towards other expenses. And although health care insurance wasn't cheap either (it cost about 40 extra) Steve and Carol didn't need assistance anymore thanks to Obamacare. That also meant they could save more right away to help out others if necessary. As usual, whenever someone came by on foot or drove past Steve's home with loud music blaring through windows, he couldn't help but roll his eyes. But really, why should he? Just yesterday one young lady named Susan stopped by asking for some change. She told him she wanted five dollars to get something to eat at McDonald's across the street. Obviously Steve gave her two dollar bills and told her to keep walking. A few minutes later another car rolled down Steve's drive way again only this time six teens piled into the vehicle along with one adult male driver. At least these guys didn't ask for money, maybe scared off after seeing what happened earlier today. In fact none of the kids said anything besides a ""Hey!"" or ""Hello!"" while passing his house before getting out once again and continuing their walk elsewhere. There must be plenty going around in town considering no fewer than three cars passed Steve within half-an-hour starting shortly after noon today. Imagine if you got paid twice your normal rate just for riding in vehicles - surely people would take advantage of that perk whenever possible. So far the majority of noise complaints come from nearby streets such as Mosely Avenue further north. Unfortunately that isn't surprising given that this is considered a low income residential area.

"We see that methylation in the A. aegypti genome is associated with reduced transcription and is most common in the promoters of genes relating to regulation of transcription and metabolism. Similar gene classes are also methylated in aphids and honeybees, suggesting either conservation or convergence of methylation patterns. In addition to this evidence of evolutionary stability, we also show that infection with the virulent wMelPop Wolbachia strain induces additional methylation and demethylation events in the genome. While most of these changes seem random with respect to gene function and have no detected effect on transcription, there does appear to be enrichment of genes associated with membrane function. Given that Wolbachia lives within a membrane-bound vacuole of host origin and retains a large number of genes for transporting host amino acids, inorganic ions and ATP despite a severely reduced genome, these changes might represent an evolved strategy for manipulating the host environments for its own gain. Testing for a direct link between these methylation changes and expression, however, will require study across a broader range of developmental stages and tissues with methods that detect splice variants.",1,pubmed_human
"We got two tower rooms connected to each other. The rooms themselves had a good amount of space and furnishings (two armchairs). Our rooms were clean and up-scale looking and reminded me of smaller versions of the suite that we stayed in at the Venetian hotel. Beds and sheets were comfortable enough. While the walls and doors were thin enough to let noise come in, the halls and rooms were usually quiet. The marble bathrooms with granite counters gave the good sized bathrooms a luscious feel. The maids were very good about getting our rooms cleaned and the amenities stocked. The tower luxory rooms had many wonderful amenities that I don't see even in higher priced hotels. Amenities included toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouth rinse, mineral baths, and lots more. The only problems were the loud fan in the room and the rooms themselves smelled heavily of cigarettes.

"On Wednesday, the office of U.S. Representative Mike Doyle in Pittsburgh faced an unforeseen disturbance when Hazmat teams were summoned to examine a white powdery material that was delivered to the premises. After the substance was discovered, the building was closed for a brief period of time as Hazmat teams evaluated it for possible hazards. Fortunately, the outcome was negative, and within nearly two hours, Congressman Doyle together with his staff managed to get back to their office. According to reports, Doyle showed his ability to remain humorous and strong during difficult times by quipping, ""My place of residence is Pittsburgh."" We don't fear anything. Even though the substance was found to be harmless, it still caused disturbance in the downtown region, resulting in the shutdown of a section of Ross Street by the authorities. The scene required the presence of federal authorities, city firefighters, and police in Pittsburgh. They took appropriate measures to handle the potential danger.

I am from the midwest so it is more popular there. Anyway, the boneless wings were not good at all and they even gave me the wrong bbq sauce. I have had better frozen wings from a grocery store. The traditional wings were just average at best. The fries here were below average. The only highlight of this place was that the food was ready on time and they lady at the bar was nice.",1,yelp_human

"Parents and carers at Camau Bach in Aberystwyth were told someone trespassed into its Green Room from the outside play area. It said police had been told and were informing the relevant authorities. Aberystwyth police said it had not received any reports of a child being lost and were investigating the claims. Parents were told on the nursery's website that the incident happened at 11:40 BST on Wednesday, and was reported by staff. The statement read: ""We would like to inform you that on Wednesday 21 June, a child was found in the Green Room. ""We believe someone has entered the Green Room from the outside play area. This is a security issue and police have been informed and the relevant authorities have been contacted."" 'Disgusting' However, parents and carers were angered by the tone of the statement, which was also posted on the nursery's Facebook page. One mother, who asked not to be named, said: ""I was very disturbed to receive that email. ""The wording is disgusting. It implies that the staff are somehow to blame. ""I had to go and pick up my son at lunchtime. The majority of parents were like me. We didn't know what was going on. ""We were very shocked and upset by the wording."" She added: ""I have a 16-month-old who goes there. I'm very upset by it. ""If anyone were to wander in and take my son, I would be devastated. It's a horrible thing to think about."" Mother Linda Carter, whose daughter also attends the nursery, said she was ""shocked"" at the email, but added: ""There's a possibility that someone may have let the child in."" Another mother, who asked not to be named, said: ""It is not acceptable and it is not a good enough response. It's not an accident. ""There should have been a bit more sympathy. They should have said that police are investigating and what they are doing about it."" Aberystwyth police said: ""The school has contacted us about a child being found in the green room of the school. ""We have not yet received any reports of a child being lost. This is now an ongoing investigation."" The nursery, which has been in operation since 2010, is rated ""good"" by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales (CSSIW). A CSSIW spokesperson said: ""We're aware that an incident has occurred at Camau Bach Nursery. ""We will be making contact with the nursery to discuss the incident."" This is not the first time a nursery has been hit by a security scare. In 2010, a 19-month-old girl was found wandering along the pavement outside a nursery in Oxford.

"CMV is about to have 50,000 members after only being active for half a year. I take important to mean that the number of subscribers and the extensive discussions allows for both incredible content (just like ask experts subreddits such as rasksocialscience) and room for anyone to join, and room to hone their evidence and perspectives. I take important to mean that this community manages to have a stronger debate structure than the other debate subreddits (like rdebatereligion) because I always see new arguments I've never seen before, and I always see most of the people involved actually caring about presenting their opinions clearly and correctly, and I feel the attitude toward debate in other subreddits doesn't have this constant promise of actual skeptical development instead of being evidence whirlwinds with no decorum in presentation or impassioned arguments that people support without questioning as long as it seems to agree with a hivemind. I could be absolutely wrong about this, but the comment u161719 made [here] received more gold than I've ever seen a comment get. While I know gold doesn't mean the community is more important, I feel like it's the way the community operates that allows for people to get into discussions that do illuminate so much of an issue that we can have truly important perspectives shared and, most importantly, these truly important perspectives receive the attention they deserve. The top voted comment in a CMV thread is almost always an incredible point of view that consistently manages to accomplish something regarding a topic. I don't mean I think CMV is merely the most important subreddit for debate among debate subreddits, I mean that it is one of the most important subreddits even among the best examples of other kinds of subreddits like news and links to interesting information, pictures, and videos.

My taxi driver was kind enough to pick me up after class too. So it's important to note, that I spent about 50 just getting to class. There are bus transportation options from the strip but I was in a hurry to make it to class on time. The fee of 24 for a drop in student included a mat, 2 towels and a large bottle of water.

She started the class on time, offered several tips throughout the class and kept me motivated with her voice. The class had about 24 students and could have fit in a few more but I was happy for the extra space. The energy from the students was great. I was a little surprised by the number of students who entered the room late. The room was pretty hot, as it should be. I could have used some air during final rest, a window or open door or something to help cool things down would have been ideal. I didn't notice any of the smells reported in the other reviews.

"I work as a psych nurse and can answer part of your question. If the person has mental illness and meets criteria for detainment (they pose a danger to themselves or others or are so psychotic they can't make decisions for themselves), then a mental health officer could be called and place the person under an emergency detention. A psych hospital can accept the person as a patient and keep them up to 72 hours for treatment. A lot of homeless people brought in on EDs don't have IDs. We just take their word for it as to what their name is. We had a psychotic person come in once under one name, got treated, discharged, stopped taking her meds, became psychotic again, and came back under a different name. Admissions didn't catch it, but we did once she got to the unit, so we changed it back to her original name just to keep all her records congruent. But honestly, we had no way of knowing which name was the correct one. She came in with nothing but the clothes on her back and 35 cents. That's living free, no ties to anything.,"" "" What happens when someone, like say a homeless person, gets arrested on the streets but has no form of ID on them? The police decide if the name provided is credible, and check if they have that information on record. If they don't, they will create a new record going forward. And say the person has a mental illness and doesn't even know hisher own name? If no name is provider, they make an effort to ID the person by other means. If that doesn't work, the create a John Doe record for them.,Most large jails use a Master Name Index (MNI) to attach all the aliases a person gives to their true identity. As stated before, everyone is fingerprinted to match you to a known person (if you have been fingerprinted in say the last 15 years or so for anything including security clearances, government jobs, previous arrests, etc.) If there is no match, then the arrestee is created as a new record. From there everyone is processed the same - booked, ran through medical, property taken, classified and housed in a cell. Honestly, the detention staff do not care what an aresstee's real name is. They just have to make sure the person brought in is tracked throughout their ""stay."" Fun interesting side note for homeless - A lot of the time homeless are brought in for trespassing or warrant for failure to appear in court. If arrested for trespassing, they are usually booked and released to show up in court at a specified date and time that will be mailed to them. Since they are homeless and usually not able to receive mail, they never know when to go to court. So they are issued a warrant for not showing up and the endless cycle begins.', ""This is a complicated question that varies not only by country, but I Canada varies by province due to the diffetent provincial health acts surrounding mental health. For the most part, in Canada at least, a person can be detained until their identity is discovered. In the case of mentally I'll individuals who are unable to even provide such information they will usually be either known to police from a last encounter or in a facility that would notice their absense. In the later case, the persons identity would be on file from the facility.

"Police issued an alert after a complaint was made that two men were acting suspiciously near secondary schools in Carrickfergus. Mysterious pictures online of a clown and a balaclava-wearing sidekick have caused a stir in the town. The police appeal caused a backlash on social media from some people who felt they were cracking down on fun. Police said they started an investigation after receiving reports from parents that their children were frightened of the clown. A police officer wrote on the PSNI Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus Facebook page: ""Fun is fun but frightening school pupils is another."" The mystery man, who calls himself the Carrick ""Killer Clown,"" contacted the police following the appeal to apologise for any distress. ""He assures me that this was a prank and it was not his intention in any way to frighten the school pupils or cause distress,"" the officer wrote. ""He fully appreciates the sensitivities of schools and photographs etc in the area of any school."" Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme the clown said he had been sent messages from people concerned about their children. ""That wasn't the aim. The aim was for a bit of fun. I'm a parent myself,"" he said. ""We thought this was a wonderful idea - to go and get this picture and it was only when somebody voiced their concern I was like'this is actually wrong, this isn't even funny'. ""I was talking to the police officer in charge again.

"The current gold standard for human activity recognition (HAR) is based on the use of cameras. However, the poor scalability of camera systems renders them impractical in pursuit of the speed with which humans can capture images at higher magnification and imaging quality needed to detect biological objects like viruses or bacteria that are impossible without having facial recognition capabilities; however, it also requires large-scale data processing capability while still capturing high resolution scenes using only small amounts of information each time a scene is viewed by cameras as well as the ability to capture larger areas than most modern browsers allow. This technology has its limitations because there needs to be considerable computing power available when image detection becomes necessary due to integration of video overlays between cameras such as the Google Pixel 2 XL, Apple iPhone XS Max, Amazon Kindle Fire HDX tablet device, and other devices that rely on the same processor architecture used to process pixels from motion picture capture or image technology developed over decades ago. The above mentioned technologies may provide adequate resolution but are not efficient enough to capture detailed imagery during an HDR event unless sensors have sufficient storage capacity to hold compressed images so that they cannot easily degrade the performance through all kinds of digital correction technologies required before bursting into the cloud via the Internet. A better way to achieve better resolution photos would involve utilizing the ease of storing pictures directly onto a computer system rather than relying solely upon captured images safeguarded by multiple bits of RAM memory installed in equipment mounted in storage cells connected to the network. An alternative approach uses computer graphics algorithms to automatically identify images stored under high workload conditions involving high traffic environments. This technique works best if the image portion of the image distribution system is optimized for competing applications including low latency capture tasks requiring viewing simultaneous capture of both foreground images per pixel position count. However this technique lacks functionality capable of reproducing images quickly generated from high resolution elements such as video clips, photographs and videos analogous to those recorded by many cell phones currently operating worldwide today.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_350m
"A recent poll revealed that the average Briton consumes 17 cups of tea each week, with one-third of women turning to tea to make them feel better when unwell. The survey, conducted with 2,000 participants across the United Kingdom, also found that tea-drinking habits increase with age. The age-old stereotype of Britons being fanatical about tea has again been confirmed in a recent poll conducted among 2,000 UK residents. The study found that the average Briton drinks 17 cups of tea per week, while almost a third of women seek solace in tea when they are feeling unwell. Of the participants, it was found that tea consumption increases as we grow older. It seems that older Britons have a stronger connection to the ritual of tea-drinking, with many of them likely developing this habit over the years and finding comfort in a cup of tea. In fact, tea has long been considered a remedy for a variety of ailments, from curing a headache to calming an upset stomach. Its antioxidants and soothing warmth make it an appealing option for those looking for a natural remedy during sickness. The survey results indicate that tea is deeply ingrained in British culture, providing a sense of routine and comfort for many people. Britons reportedly drink more than 100 million cups of tea daily, with tea making up around 40 of the total beverage consumption in the country. Despite the prevalence of tea-drinking, the UK still lags behind countries like Turkey and Ireland in per capita consumption. However, with the many ways in which Britons enjoy their tea (black, with milk, or a squeeze of lemon), the versatility of this beloved beverage is undoubtedly a testament to its popularity. Tea-drinking seems to be a matter of both tradition and habit in the UK, and the fact that such a significant percentage of Britons turn to tea when unwell emphasizes the important role this beverage continues to play in the daily lives of people across the country.",0,cnn_gpt4
"There is limited evidence to conclusively determine the efficiency of the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach with double precontoured locking plate fixation in the treatment of Orthopaedic Trauma Association type C distal humerus fractures. Some studies suggest that this surgical approach may provide satisfactory outcomes for patients with complex distal humerus fractures, but further research is needed to compare this approach with other surgical techniques and treatment modalities. A study conducted by Huang et al. (2018) assessed the clinical outcomes of using the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach in combination with double precontoured locking plate fixation to treat Orthopaedic Trauma Association type C distal humerus fractures. The results of this study indicated that the procedure produced favorable outcomes, with a low complication rate and good functional recovery. However, this conclusion is limited by the small sample size of the study, and more extensive research studies are needed to evaluate the true efficiency of this approach. It's also important to note that the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach may not be suitable for all patients, and individual factors such as age, overall health, and the complexity of the fracture should be considered when determining the appropriate treatment strategy. An individualized assessment of each patient is necessary, ideally involving multidisciplinary teams of experienced orthopedic surgeons and medical professionals. In conclusion, the existing literature on the efficiency of the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach with double precontoured locking plate fixation for the treatment of Orthopaedic Trauma Association type C distal humerus fractures is limited. Further research is required to definitively establish the effectiveness of this procedure in comparison to alternative treatment strategies.",0,pubmed_gpt4

"This paper considers a network of stochastic evidence accumulators, each represented by a drift-diffusion model accruing evidence towards a decision in continuous time by observing a noisy signal and by rendering an estimate of its probability distribution. We consider a stochastically varying weather station as our data source. To this end we construct two versions of the stochastic evidence accumulation model. In one version the probability density function is assumed to be Gaussian on the order of the mean squared error (MSE); in the other it is assumed that the noise level is uncorrelated with the data but is related to the natural signal intensity at some fixed point. The second version has been shown to perform better than a purely stationary case for estimating the posterior described below under both the MSE assumption and uncorrelation assumption; see, e.g., cite38. A pairwise importance correlation is computed between the covariate estimates from the models. Our model is able to compute a correct estimate for the likelihood ratio test (LRT) if, after fitting the nonparametric statistics, the measurements are correlated (see Yee, III.2). Using the above assumptions about the noise-correlating properties of the environment, the second variation performs well even when the random variability is zero or nearly so. The noise level may vary randomly across samples, which would not interfere significantly with our simulation. However, this effect could still make models such as the Gaussian model more prone to overfitting in cases where observations follow a deterministic trend.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b

"There are way too many negligent and otherwise incompetent drivers on the road, and the penalties for this should be much more harsh. Having to deal with incompetent drivers is the worst part of being in a car. I do not think that the fines should be higher because that will not solve the problem. We are way too generous letting people keep their license after proving a blatant disregard for their own safety and the safety of the people unfortunate enough to have to share the road with them. Below are some examples of how I would like to see penalties handed out in the future. These are only meant to be a representation of what I am talking about when I say that the penalties should be 'much more harsh'. I do not want people to try to change my view on how long a person should lose hisher license if they commit one of the infractions below, I only want to debate whether or not the concept is rational. I will preface this by saying that I live in the US and have no idea how other countries penalize drivers for similar infractions. I am also ignoring all additional penalties enforced by outside parties: insurance companies, civil lawsuits, criminal charges, etc. (After having your license suspended, drivers will be required to take a driver's education course, pass a written driving competency exam, and take a 'behind the wheel' driving course with a certified instructor, until the instructor deems that the offender is capable of driving without supervision (similar to what teen agers do to get their license in the first place) Crashing into a stationary object (building, telephone pole, stop sign, etc) : License suspended for a minimum of 30 days. Crashing into a another car: License suspended for a minimum of 7 days. Written apology to every person whose time you wasted by slowing down traffic. penalty doubled if the car you hit is not moving penalty tripled if you are in traffic or a city penalty quintupled if you hit another car while rubbernecking another accident driving privileges suspended indefinitely if you run into another accident on the side of the road. Driving slow in the passing lane: License suspended for a minimum of 7 days. Written apology to every person whose time you wasted by slowing down traffic. (slow is anything less than or equal to the posted speed limit for the area. Additionally, if you are being tailgated or people are passing you on the rightI don't care how fast you think you are goingyou aren't driving fast enough. Get out of the passing lane.) Impeding the flow of traffic: License suspended for a minimum of 7 days. Written apology to every person whose time you wasted by slowing down traffic. (Similar to the previous, but enforced in any lane. If you are not keeping pace with a single car around youI don't care how fast you think you are goingyou are making the road more dangerous by forcing people swerving around you. If you ever think, ""Wow, everyone is driving so fast,"" you should actually be thinking ""Wow, I must be driving so slow Attempting to merge while going under the speed limithitting your breaks in the merge lane: License suspended for a minimum of 7 days. (Nobody wants to let you over when you're at a full stop in the merge lane and you're fucking with the cars behind you who are trying to use the merge lane properly. Nobody wants to let you over when you are going under the speed limit. Merge lanes exist for a reasonget up to speed, or keep driving around the cloverleaf until you are going fast enough to drive on a highway.) These would be the penalties for the first offense. The length of suspension should be larger with each subsequent suspense. I could probably keep going for a while, but I think you get the idea. So, CMV Edit: I also hate the word 'accident'. Running into something in your car isn't an 'accident', it's you being a dumbs Edit 2: Nobody has mentioned this, but I will. Cops will server the same penalties. Edit 3: I love how people are downvoting my post and all my comments because they disagree (which goes against the entire point of this subreddit). Meanwhile I still haven't heard a single good counter argument. Is this really the best you can do? Edits for common arguments below (if I see the same thing twice it goes here) Q: Why? A: First of all, I think what I proposed is a lot more constructive than the current system. Currently, if you run into another car you are responsible for paying for the damages to the person unfortunate enough to have hisher entire day interrupted by your negligence. This is a great rule, but it doesn't go far enough because it doesn't address the original issue. Nothing is done to improve the offenders driving ability, there is no evaluation of whether of or not the offender was evan fit to be driving. Q: What about weathercar malfunctionacts of god? A: These penalties will only be enforced if it is determined to be driver error (which IIRC the legal system already determines this for accidents for insurance reasons). Weathercar failureetc can make it harder to driver safely, but it doesn't make it impossible. These will have to be handled by a case-by-case basis Q: How does the driver know where to send apology letters? A: This system would work via GPS and a mobile app like [Waze] . When there is an accident, everyone within a certain radius of the collision gets a notification at which point you can opt-in for an apology letter via the app. Once you opt-in the driver gets your information (email or address based on user preference and privacy concerns) at which point they will be required to apologize to everyone on the list.",1,cmv_human

"Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very short bursts, they can become spores on a reef filter. The leaves of crabs will often appear from time to time as colorful, long-lasting white spots on the surface (still fresh) that resemble small yellow or red spots, which look like ""brown"" algae growing in their water bodies. These small green spots can eventually change color with the migration of light into the bottom. They can also form into bulbous hairs when wet with ice. The flowers are usually cut off, then moved onto another coral reef to supply fresh air. In some cases, however, these blooms take longer than expected to develop because sunlight is not absorbed by the larvae and the food they consume. Some species don't survive well for many years after being abandoned, although there's no reason why should they not be returned. Other species live for an extended period before being pollinated again.

"Arthritis is when your joints hurt and feel stiff. It happens when the soft part inside your joints (called cartilage) gets worn away or damaged. This can make it harder to move your body and make you feel uncomfortable. To diagnose arthritis, a doctor might look at your joints and ask you to move them around. They might also take pictures of your joints or take a sample of the fluid inside them. There are ways to lessen the symptoms of arthritis besides taking anti-inflammatory medication. One way is to exercise regularly to keep your joints moving and build strength. Eating a healthy diet can also help because certain foods can make arthritis worse. Your doctor might also suggest using special tools, like a cane or braces, to help your joints move more easily. Finally, you can try using heat or ice to reduce any pain or swelling in your joints.",0,eli5_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"Sales in the UK retail sector rose by more than expected in November, as shops offered promotions at the end of the month in the run up to Black Friday. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that retail sales grew by 1.1 on a monthly basis in November, which was higher than the 0.7 increase that had been forecast by economists. The ONS said that the main driver of the sales growth was the non-food sector, which saw sales rise by 1.5 on the month. Black Friday, which falls on the last Friday in November, is a key date in the retail calendar, as retailers offer heavy discounts in an attempt to boost sales. This year, Black Friday fell on 29th November, and it appears that many shoppers took advantage of the promotions on offer, with the ONS reporting that sales were up across all types of retail businesses in November. The news will come as a boost to the UK retail sector, which has been under pressure in recent months amid concerns about the health of the economy. The strong sales figures in November suggest that consumers are still willing to spend, despite the Brexit uncertainty that continues to hang over the UK.",0,xsum_machine_specified_text-davinci-002

"People used to retire at a certain age and die of old age within the next decade or two at most. They would then pass their estates on to their children after being entirely self-sustaining during their retirement years. Now, people have retired or are retiring and are looking forward to 20, 30 years of doing fuck all, not contributing to the economy in any major fashion except in one huge area: healthcare. Some need joints replaced, they need drugs to keep their bodies from falling apart, they need 247 care and supervision. These costs pile up and quickly dwarf the money they get from pensions, investments, etc, and their children are forced to support them; forced to be their financial life support. And again, to what end? BACKGROUND OF MY GRANDMOTHER; NOT MANDATORY READING BUT HELPS CLEAR UP MY VIEWS In 2002, my grandfather died at 80 from pancreatic cancer after retiring at 60. We found out after he died that he was covering up for my grandmother's extreme Alzheimer's and dementia. He told no one, and she was not on any of the few preventative drugs there were at the time. Within one year, we took her into our home to keep her safe. She was diagnosed and given drugs and improved, and she moved home. She was there for another year, after which she fell and broke her hip. It was replaced and she moved back in with us for a few months before moving back home again. It was shortly after that that, in 2004, that her Alzheimer's and dementia outpaced what the drugs could do, and we got her into a retirement home. She has been there since. By 2008, she no longer knew her children or grandchildren, or close friends. She now remembers 3 of her 8 siblings, and has fuzzy memories of her husband of more than 60 years. I'm a very practical person. She isn't there anymore. Her body houses a whisper of who she was. To me, my grandmother is no longer alive. In the eight years since 2004, she has been in 247 care, which costs thousands of dollars per month. Half of this is covered by money earned from her extremely diverse investment portfolio build by my grandfather. Most of the rest goes to the taxpayers, and the remainder to my mother to pay. Physically speaking, she is fairly well off. She is fit for her age and is mostly mobile, just slow. Others in her retirement though are horrifying. They give me nightmares. They sit in wheelchairs and drool on themselves, piss or shit themselves, moan (in what I can only guess is pain) or sit or lie around all day and actually look dead. Sit around all day, watching television they don't understand because they are mentally stuck in the past or don't even notice it. Why. Why does anyone ever want to do that? That is not dignity. That is horrible. BACKGROUND I think that if in general, people volunteered for euthanasia a few years post retirement, while they were still of sound body and mind, they would end the selfish practices of artificial life extension for fully sentimental reasons. Some years after they retire, they could elect to move on while they still remember how who they are and how to not drool on themselves. While they still have their spouses; before they die without them. While they still remember loved ones and friends. They could just move on instead of spending years in a facility they hate just so that their families can rest easy that they are taken care of and know that they can come and see them whenever they want to, like animals in a zoo.",1,cmv_human
"Autofocus (AF) methods are extensively used in biomicroscopy, for example to acquire timelapses, where the imaged objects tend to drift out of focus. AF algorithms determine an optimal distance by which to move the sample back into the focal plane. Current hardware-based methods require modifying the microscope and image-based algorithms either rely on many images to converge to the sharpest position or need training data and models specific to each instrument and imaging configuration. Here we propose DeepFocus, an AF method we implemented as a Micro-Manager plugin, and characterize its Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -based sharpness function, which we observed to be depth co-variant and sample-invariant. Sample invariance allows our AF algorithm to converge to an optimal axial position within as few as three iterations using a model trained once for use with a wide range of optical microscopes and a single instrument-dependent calibration stack acquisition of a flat (but arbitrary) textured object. From experiments carried out both on synthetic and experimental data, we observed an average precision, given 3 measured images, of 0.30 0.16 m with a 10 , NA 0.3 objective. We foresee that this performance and low image number will help limit photodamage during acquisitions with light-sensitive samples.",1,sci_gen_human

"Geoffrey Lewis, Esteemed Character Actor and Eastwood Collaborator, Passes Away at 79 Hollywood has lost another icon, as Geoffrey Lewis, the esteemed character actor who was a frequent collaborator with Clint Eastwood, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 79. The actor leaves behind an impressive legacy of work in the entertainment industry, having appeared in numerous movies and television shows throughout the years. Born in 1935 in San Diego, California, Lewis began his career on the stage before moving on to film and television roles in the 1970s. He worked with Eastwood early in his career, appearing in the western ""High Plains Drifter"" in 1973. The partnership proved to be fruitful, as they went on to collaborate in films like ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" ""Every Which Way But Loose,"" and ""Bronco Billy."" In addition to his work with Eastwood, Lewis also starred opposite Robert Redford in ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" and appeared in films such as ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Night of the Comet."" His television credits include guest-starring roles on shows like ""Hawaii Five-0,"" ""The A-Team,"" ""The X-Files,"" ""Murder, She Wrote,"" and ""Law Order: Criminal Intent."" Despite his extensive career, Lewis will perhaps best be remembered as a loving and supportive father to actress Juliette Lewis. His daughter, who has since become famous in her own right, has often cited her father as a major influence in her life. She took to social media following his passing, sharing a heartfelt message in which she called him ""my hero"" and stated that she was ""forever my favorite man.""

"Burnley Empire Theatre defaulted to the care of the Duchy of Lancaster as an ""owner of last resort"" after the ownership could not be established. Last used as a bingo hall, the building is currently derelict. The Duchy of Lancaster has completed the transfer of the freehold of the former Burnley Empire Theatre to Burnley Borough Council. Plans are now being developed to restore the building for use as a theatre for performing arts and as a venue for conferences, events and functions. The Duchy of Lancaster was informed by the local authority that it intended to compulsorily purchase the former theatre and the building has now been transferred to the Council by way of a vesting order. The Duchy was appointed to act as the ""owner of last resort"" by the Ministry of Justice in December 2012, following the collapse of the previous ownership in 2010 and the dissolution of the theatre's company. In 2011, the Duchy of Lancaster commissioned a detailed viability study to establish whether the Empire Theatre could be redeveloped and sustained as a theatre. Although it was clear that restoring the Grade II listed building would be a significant undertaking, the study concluded that with the right level of funding, a viable and sustainable business could be created. Since then, the Duchy has actively marketed the building to interested parties and was delighted to learn that the local authority was keen to develop a community asset on the site.

"The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The White House said North Korea should ""focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations."" The US and North Korea agreed the reactor should be shut down in return for aid at talks in New York last month. However, the deal was not signed because of a dispute over how the shutdown would be verified. North Korea had earlier refused to honour a deal reached in 1994 under which it agreed to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for two lightwater reactors and heavy oil supplies. The US has also been pressing North Korea to declare all its nuclear facilities and allow international inspectors access to them.

"Graphlets are induced subgraph patterns and have been frequently applied to characterize the local topology structures of graphs across various domains, e.g., online social networks (OSNs) and biological networks. Discovering new graphlets and analyzing their impact on graph properties are two key problems in graphlet mining. However, all the existing graphlet mining methods can only handle a single graph, which cannot capture the essential information across multiple graphs. Moreover, these methods usually suffer from high time complexity and cannot provide efficient mining results for large-scale graphs. Motivated by these limitations, we propose an efficient graphlet mining method, named gMiner, in this paper. gMiner is a new graphlet mining framework, which can provide efficient and high-quality results for graphlet mining across multiple graphs. We first define a new measure, called graphlet density (GD), to measure the density of each graphlet in a graph. And then, we present an effective graphlet mining algorithm with four stages, including graph partition, graphlet counting, graphlet matching, and graphlet ranking. We also propose a new greedy algorithm, called GA, for graph partition. The extensive experiments demonstrate that gMiner is able to provide both high-quality and efficient graphlet mining results.

"Mice's ability to resist secondary infections of Echinostoma caproni may be linked to the production of certain immune proteins, specifically those produced in the ileum. This is supported by some evidence. Echinostoma caproni is a type of parasitic flatworm that invades the small intestines of rodents and results in the development of echinostomiasis. The immune response produced during the first infection can cause mice to acquire resistance to subsequent infections. The ability to resist parasites is commonly linked to the creation of particular immune proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies, which play a crucial role in protecting the host. According to research conducted by Cortes and colleagues in 2017, when mice were initially infected with Echinostoma caproni, a variety of cytokines and immune modulators were upregulated, resulting in a decrease in worm burden during subsequent infections. Also, studies have shown that the generation of specific cytokines such as interleukin-13 (IL-13) can induce an escalation in mucus production, smooth muscle constriction, and elevated turnover of epithelial cells. These factors might play a role in expelling parasites from the gastrointestinal tract, according to Dawson et al. (2005). In general, although there are indications of a correlation between ileal protein production and the ability of mice to resist secondary Echinostoma caproni infections, additional investigations are required to comprehensively comprehend the mechanisms underpinning this resistance. The sources cited are Cortes et al.'s (2017) study conducted by Esteban, Munoz-Antoli, and Toledo. The immunity against intestinal helminths has both visible and concealed aspects in the form of Th2 and Th1 responses. The publication titled ""Trends in Parasitology"" presents information on parasitology in its 33rd volume, issue number 8, spanning from pages 678 to 693. In 2005, a group of researchers including Dawson, H. D., Beshah, E., Nishi, S., Solano-agama, C., Morimoto, M., Zhao, A., and Urban, J. F. conducted a study.

"I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about him suggests he's just not a man of principle, he's a man of pragmatism. A cynic, not a hero. But what is that, I wonder, if not the role of the unprincipled? Tuesday, November 29, 2007 At the time of this posting, I have just discovered that I am one of the proudest people in the world. In the interest of time, I shall give you the basic details: I am currently a resident of Britain, but for a number of years I have been living in the United States, and now that I am moving back to the UK I have been given a great honour. I have been awarded a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Texas, Austin. This means that I now have a doctorate, in mathematics, from one of the best universities in the world. In the history of mathematics, no British citizen has ever received a PhD from this university, so I feel quite a bit of pride. In fact, I have been feeling rather proud since I read the news. I'm not going to go into details, but it's just that it's the sort of thing that I had only dreamed of, and I am rather proud to have done it. I've also been reading some comments about the news, and I have noticed that there are some people who are not too happy with the news. Some of the reasons they give are that I have done it in a rather unconventional way, and that I have done it by taking advantage of a few opportunities. I am quite happy with the first reason, and it is very possible that I will do something else unconventional in the future. I think it is a good idea to learn to do things unconventionally. It is always nice to be different, and the fact that you are different from the crowd can be a source of pride. But the second reason is not one I would like to use. I have never done anything illegal, and I have always taken every opportunity that came my way to work towards my goals. I am not a coward, I am not a dishonest person, and I have never tried to cheat anyone. So it is hard for me to understand why people are so angry with me. It is one thing to have an unconventional way of doing things, but it is quite another to have an unconventional approach to morals. Monday, November 28, 2007 A few days ago, I had an idea for a short story. I was wondering what would happen if you could go to the future, and so I thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if you could go to the past. I could write a story about what would happen if you went to the past, and I could write a story about what would happen if you went to the future, but the idea that came to me was to write a story about going to the past. So here is my story. The Go Back The gadget arrived on a hot summer day in 1980. It was delivered by the postman, and it was a white box, and it had a thin strip of black plastic across the top. It had no instructions, but the postman said that the instructions would be inside. Inside was a little grey box with a dial on it, and a plastic button, and a few lines of printed text. The box was ajar, and the text read: ""This is a device for making the future known to you. Turn the dial to the number that you want to know, and press the button. The future will then be shown to you."" When I turned the dial to the number I wanted to know, I saw that it was 1980. I thought that this was a bit odd, because it was obvious that the box was not set to 1980, so I pressed the button. Then I saw that it was a different time. It was the time of my life. It was the time of my career. It was the time of my family. It was the time of my children. I saw the future that was going to happen to me, and I felt a little confused. I saw that I was going to be a brilliant scientist, that I was going to win many awards, and that I was going to be a big success. I saw that I was going to have a family, and that I was going to be very happy. But I saw that I was going to die, and that it was going to be a very sad death. I looked at my family, and I saw that they were all going to die too, and that they were all going to die very sad deaths.",0,cmv_machine_continuation_GLM130B

In this paper we use AD for stating and solving solid mechanics problems. Given a finite element discretization of the domain, we evaluate the free energy of the solid as the integral of its strain energy density, and we make use of AD for directly obtaining the residual force vector and the tangent stiffness matrix of the problem, as the gradient and the Hessian of the free energy respectively. The result is a remarkable simplification in the statement and the solution of complex problems involving non trivial constraints systems and both geometrical and material non linearities. Together with the continuum mechanics theoretical basis, and with a description of the specific AD technique adopted, the paper illustrates the solution of a number of solid mechanics problems, with the aim of presenting a convenient numerical implementation approach, made easily available by recent programming languages, to the solid mechanics community.",1,sci_gen_human

"Behavioural economists have shown that people are often averse to inequality and will make choices to avoid unequal outcomes. In this paper, we consider how to allocate indivisible goods fairly in the marketplace when there is demand for them by many individuals who may want more than their fair share of these resources (that which they believe others deserve). We show that an individual's preference over her own allocation depends on what she thinks other agents should receive. She can be motivated either by fairness or envy - each with different implications for behavior under uncertainty about the amount shared. Thus our model captures key features of both social preferences and inequity aversion found across multiple domains including labor markets, health care provision, taxation, charitable giving, insurance contracts against theft, bargaining among criminal gangs, prisoners' dilemma games, and public choice theory.""

Zverev, 19, had recovered a break early in the final set before requiring treatment for cramp. Nadal, 30, goes on to face France's Gael Monfils, who beat German Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-4. Canadian third seed Milos Raonic made it through to the last 16 with a 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 3-6 6-3 win over Frenchman Gilles Simon. Zverev has long been touted as a future world number one and it appeared as though he would make his Grand Slam breakthrough against Nadal. The teenager's big serve and brilliant backhand earned him a 2-1 lead after three sets, only for ninth seed Nadal to battle his way back in characteristic fashion. It is almost three years since Nadal won his 14th major title at the 2014 French Open, and that was the last time he got past the quarter-finals at a Grand Slam. Injuries have taken their toll, but it was Zverev whose fitness failed him in the closing stages on Rod Laver Arena. The German won a gruelling 37-shot early in the final set but the damage was done as he could not recover fully, despite treatment from the trainer. ""I won by fighting and running a lot,"" said Nadal. ""I think everybody knows how good Alexander is. He's the future of our sport and the present too. ""It's been a very tough match for me. I didn't start playing my best and I was not feeling very well because I was losing too much court. When I felt I was feeling better I had more time to control from the baseline.

"Scientists have observed electrical activity similar to the brain activity of premature babies in lab-grown brains. The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a dish. The brain contains more than 86 billion nerve cells, called neurons, that are connected to one another. The cells constantly communicate with each other via electrical signals. The researchers at the University of Cambridge have created an artificial ""mini-brain"" in a dish by seeding human stem cells with the genes that make a neuron, and then they injected these cells into a dish with a nutrient soup. The cells developed into a mini-brain that fires signals similar to those in a baby's brain. The lab-grown brains were found to have a higher electrical activity than mature brain cells, which is similar to the electrical activity of the human brain. ""One of the most important things is that they respond to drugs in the same way as human brain cells in a dish,"" says Alexander Gomez-Dominguez, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience at the university, who is the first author of the paper. ""This is very important, because we need to understand how to treat premature babies after birth. Also, we have to develop new drugs for people with brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,"" Gomez-Dominguez says. The brain is a complex organ that has diverse functions. For example, it is responsible for our thoughts, movements, senses, and emotions. ""Premature birth is the main cause of death in children under 5 years old, and it is also the cause of a number of neurological and developmental problems in newborns,"" Gomez-Dominguez says. ""The major causes of premature birth are infection, miscarriage, and abortion,"" he says. ""But we need to develop new drugs, and we need to understand how the human brain works so that we can help people with brain diseases."" The brain's developing embryo has a lot of cells and it is a very sensitive organ. So, it is crucial to understand how the brain works and how it develops. ""The brains of mammals, including humans, develop and form in very similar ways. They all start from the same embryo,"" Gomez-Dominguez says. ""In the developing embryo, it is very easy to grow brain cells, but it is very difficult to grow mature brain cells in a dish. We want to be able to take cells from the developing embryo and to grow them in the lab so that we can study them and use them to treat people with brain diseases."" ""This is a major advance,"" says Dr. Joseph Vonsattel, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""It's a very creative idea, and the technology has the potential to advance our understanding of the biology of neurodevelopment in ways that we have never been able to do before."" The researchers tested the mini-brains with a compound called rapamycin, which is already used to treat organ transplant rejection and kidney disease. ""Rapamycin is a very good compound for reducing the immune response,"" Gomez-Dominguez says. ""It also reduces cell growth. In our study, the mini-brain responded to rapamycin in the same way as mature brain cells."" Gomez-Dominguez says that this is the first study to show that the mini-brain can be used to study neurodevelopment. ""It is very important to study how the brain works, and it is also very important to understand how the brain develops,"" he says. ""The big question is how we can use this technology to help people with brain diseases. The next step is to see whether we can develop new drugs that we can give to mature human brain cells in a dish."" The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers are developing a model that is similar to the mini-brain. This new model contains just a few cells and a very limited network of connections between the cells. The researchers believe that this new model will help them to understand how the brain develops. ""In the new model, we can control what happens. We can add different drugs to see how they affect the growth of the brain,"" Gomez-Dominguez says. ""We hope that we can develop new drugs and we can develop better ways to treat people with brain",0,tldr_machine_continuation_7B

"Doppler effect is a fundamental phenomenon that appears in wave propagation, where a moving observer experiences dilation or contraction of wavelength of a wave. It also appears in radio frequency (RF) wireless communication when there exists a relative movement between the transmitter and the receiver, and is widely considered as a major impairment for reliable wireless communication. The current paper proposes Doppler Assisted Wireless Communication (DAWC), that exploits Doppler effect and uses kinetic energy for co-channel interference (CCI) mitigation. The proposed system also exploits the propagation environment and the network topology, and consists of an access point (AP) with a rotating drum antenna. The rotating drum receive antenna is designed in such a way that it shifts the interfering signals away from the desired signal band. This paper includes a detailed system model, and the results show that under favorable fading conditions, co-channel interference can be significantly reduced. Therefore, it is anticipated that more sophisticated wireless systems and networks can be designed by extending the basic ideas proposed herein.",1,sci_gen_human
"Short answer No one knows, but most neuroscientists agree that different parts of the brain are responsible for producing different ""thoughts"" or ""feelings."" How they originate is still a mystery (there isn't a ""CPU"" or ""control room"" part of the brain where all electrical signals originate - they seem to come from everywhere). Long Answer This has been debated for thousands of years by the most intelligent philosophers, theologians, and scientists who have ever lived, and none of them really agreed on it. Augustinian (and Thomas Aquinas, after him) believed thoughts to be of ""the spirit of God,"" a divine gift given to us as humans. Immanuel Kant believed thoughts were representations of how our senses falsely perceive the world. This gets super complicated (and he wrote a lengthy book on it), but suffice it to say, thoughts are our brains' way of making sense of all the sensory information it receives and tries to organize. Sigmund Freud believed that thoughts were the playing out of a mental battle in your brain between your desire to be altruistic (your superego), your desire to be selfish (your id), and your desire to be logical (your ego). He believed, in a way, that we really don't have much control over our thoughts. Several epistemologists would say that thoughts are our brain trying to make sense of what it is learning, similar to Immanuel Kant's theory. Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that our thoughts are defined by our language, and it is impossible to think without language. So, our thoughts are our brain talking to itself (a joke, but it summarizes the point). And then there's the science of [cognition] (URL1), which studies how and why we think, but they don't really have as much of a ""why"" as a ""here's what happens"" kind of thing. And then there's [epistemology] (URL0), which is the philosophy of learning and knowledge. The list goes on and on and on. You're asking a really good question that we've been asking for thousands of years. If you find the right answer, be sure to let us know:D",1,eli5_human

"You are waiting where you were told to wait. It has been fifteen minutes and no one has addressed you. You are standing in a small white room, behind you with your bookcase. The three of us sit through these pages about the change. These books I have read that say you should be taking care of yourself as soon as possible before touching your family. I don't know how long this will last, but we're going to start there. We lay on our backs and look toward the bright blue sky; the sunlight is falling. The crab didn't exactly want to watch this day pass by or the sun was shining. We'd walked into the room but he went back on his way and gave me the choice: ""Well, I'm over here now."" He said ""I'll wait for you at home."" Then he left with the following message from his phone:""There's nothing we can do about it."" That night I woke up wondering what time it could really get any worse? Is it too late for you to head out and please take care of yourselves after all this trouble? How would you feel if you had just stood there watching yourself die? I skipped the part when the doctor asked if my appendix was okay. I thought I might need a little help. After a few hours of thinking about it I found myself asking again... It wasn't until a month later that I finally got permission to go talk to an emergency doctor. First she prescribed me something called noxorubicin (the stuff used to treat cancer). She couldn't tell me if it worked so well because she wouldn't let me put it on the arm. So I took her advice and started on a very gradual program that made everything better. Now I've learned it's only right that people take care of themselves first. I did make some progress. For two months I continued on a program that doesn't work so well because everyone wants their own happy ending. This started the process of making things better than they could have ever hoped for. For many years I had been feeling tired and stressed. I even had annoying friends who literally wanted everything changed. I knew that I needed money to spend on things like food or water. I decided that I'd buy myself a new job as well. When I saw this plan working I immediately tried it. My wife had taken the additional step of buying herself a new house. Having already bought myself a place she suddenly felt better. Same thing happened to me. I could sleep good nights wrapped around my body, eating healthy foods and having fun. Every once in awhile I would catch myself dreaming about it. But never in the dream. And every time I think of it I remember that I haven't seen him since then. That's why I waited another year for him to come back. I stopped worrying about improving myself in both ways. I was living life with my thoughts and feelings moving along. Still I still worry about whether or not I've done enough to make anyone happy or if they're being killed. I try to enjoy my time because I have more energy now. After I realized how much energy I had remaining I began doing what I loved best. As someone who has spent most of my life working towards happiness and achievement and peace in my life, I am aware that this is the most difficult path to live. Not only is the decision to say yes to this approach difficult, it often takes the form of guilt. No matter how great things seem, sometimes they become too important to ignore. Something about life has taught me to recognize that thoughts and emotions may not be worth everything if they prevent them from happening. Painful decisions aren't always easy to avoid, but self-doubt is impossible to overcome either. The following steps prove that my attitude and confidence are not worth everything. Once you find out that someone else's pain won't stop until you stop believing in that person, you will begin to consider it all. Don't give up on anything! Emotion is hard to find and it can take a while to get the courage to talk up a problem. Then once you realize it, you must accept it. Life isn't a glass half full deal. When you decide to stop caring about yourself and focus on peace and love, you will lead a life that belongs to you. Andrea McBride can be reached at",0,wp_machine_continuation_opt_125m

"Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",1,sci_gen_human

"Family Pet Leo Nearly Burned Down Home in Peckham, South-East London A family pet named Leo almost caused complete devastation after it accidentally started a severe blaze in a home in Peckham, south-east London. Leo, a Staffordshire-Boxer cross, set the ground-floor kitchen alight after he managed to switch on the cooker while hunting for food. Leo's antics led to a third of the ground-floor of the property being significantly damaged. The reason why the mischievous canine inadvertently caused such a disastrous fire was due to a child's car seat left on top of one of the hob's rings. The car seat subsequently caught fire after the dog unknowingly switched the hob on, leading to the blaze quickly spreading throughout the kitchen and causing extensive damage. Firefighters later confirmed that the car seat left on the hob increased the likelihood of the extreme destruction. A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said, ""Never leave anything on the cooktop other than pots and pans when cooking, even when the hob is not in use, as we never know when a pet could accidentally switch it on."" The London Fire Brigade arrived on the scene after receiving a call about the incident, and their prompt action and response ensured that the fire did not spread to other parts of the property. Fortunately, the family members and the pet dog, Leo, were able to escape from the home safe and unharmed. The homeowners have been reminded of the dangers of placing any items on top of their cookers and the importance of monitoring their pet's movements to minimize risk. As winter approaches, the London Fire Brigade urges the public to remain vigilant and pay attention to fire safety in their homes.

"In some countries, formal education can take place through home schooling. Informal learning may be assisted by a teacher occupying a transient or ongoing role, such as a family member, neighbour (e.g., aunt), community leader, civic official, etc. Home schooled children are still considered 'home-schoolers' and they have to follow the same guidelines on academic achievement in schools that other students do; for example, attendance at school, punctuality, good behaviour, and those rules of conduct and manners which apply everywhere else. However, parents cannot decide what their child is taught - the only choice lies with teachers appointed by governments. For instance, when teachers teach religious subjects like Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism or Buddhism, it could be argued that these lessons are not taught within any system of government control but outside the country's public educational framework under private sponsorship. In addition to this, teachers who work directly or indirectly for foreign embassies or consulates would also fall under the definition of ""government"" because of the close relationship between them and the State DepartmentUS embassy.[22] As an alternative model where there is no governmental oversight, parents and guardians provide daycare services [23].

Migrant Workers International Association was founded in 1994 based upon principles of human rights, social justice, peace and solidarity among different nations of origin, destination and transit.[28] The main objectives are bringing together national organizations representing migrant worker struggles across the globe, organizing international conferences meetings amongst various groups affiliated with MWIA, disseminating information regarding global issues affecting the lives of migrant workers so far lacking adequate representation, creating awareness within communities and developing legislation geared towards protecting migrants interests and promoting wellbeing of both host nations and transiting migrant populations and ensuring fairness, equity, freedom, dignity, equality before law and just treatment of all persons regardless of how they came to reside in another land, nationality or status whether naturalized, permanent residents or visa holders, share common values and aspirations of improving conditions of life, empowerment and economic growth for everyone - particularly the most marginalised sections of society - especially civil society actors, advocacy organisations, policy makers, NGOs, researchers, journalists, non profit agencies, academics, faith leaders anyone who believes in and works diligently for fair labour standards, equal employment opportunity and decent working environment. The organization also aims to foster dialogue amongst rival groups and build bridges between the struggle movements currently active against exploitative practices carried out by employers. It advocates poverty alleviation programs benefiting low skilled domestic labourers mostly found working in construction sites, informal fields, hotels, restaurants and catering sector along major highways and city areas throughout India. The term refugee includes someone who meets one or more criteria described below if forced removal to a third country would result in persecution or torture. Refugees typically seek safety due to political instability, war crimes committed against them, or violence in their homeland.[29] Some refugees settle permanently in a particular place, whereas others move frequently until reaching a new safe haven. They must also maintain contact with humanitarian officials in order to continue receiving assistance once they reach their destination. A person applying for asylum will generally present proof that his or her life might be threatened if returned to his or her country of origin. To qualify as refugees, applicants need established links with a state or territory that provides protection and guarantees them access to basic needs.[30] Some scholars consider immigration restrictionist policies to be anti-democratic because they deny certain individuals who should enjoy free movement of ideas and persons whatever reasons they wish. Thus, devout Muslims are denied entry under pretext that religion constitutes a threat to democracy, ethnic minorities similar to Buddhists are barred from entering Hong Kong, and Christians wishing to relocate to New Zealand are pressured to abandon their beliefs. Such ideologies stipulate that the right to enter a given jurisdiction belongs to the citizenry rather than the state itself, and thus require citizens of one state to give up their legal protections afforded via citizenship elsewhere.

"Queens Park Rangers Cruise to 4-1 Victory Over Baggies, Boosting Confidence for Relegation Battle Queens Park Rangers have struck a major win in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation by scoring a thumping 4-1 victory over the Baggies. Midfielder Joey Barton believes that this away win will provide his side with a great boost of confidence as they strive to rise above their current 18th position in the league standings. QPR, currently sitting in the relegation zone, knew that each game from here on out would be crucial to their top-flight survival. However, few could have predicted the manner in which they dispatched the Baggies. With four goals and a convincing win under their belt, it seems the Rangers may be hitting form at just the right time, giving hope to their fans and players alike that they can indeed secure their place in the Premier League. Barton, who has seen his share of ups and downs in the league, is adamant that this victory over the Baggies will have a profound effect on the mindset of the QPR squad, stating, ""This win can definitely be a turning point for us. Going into a game, away from home, against a side like the Baggies, it's always going to be tough. But we stuck together, worked hard, and got the rewards for it."" The experienced midfielder went on to say that it was important for the team to maintain the momentum gained from this performance and carry it forth into their upcoming fixtures. ""If we can channel this level of commitment and belief, then it's possible to turn things around for us and avoid relegation,"" he added. As the season nears its dramatic end, all eyes are on the bottom of the Premier League table, with several clubs embroiled in a tense battle to avoid the drop. The pressure is undoubtedly mounting, but with gritty and determined displays like the one seen against the Baggies, Queens Park Rangers may yet have a fighting chance.",0,cnn_gpt4

"Dis come in either active or passive forms. Most six string guitars are passive by design (no amplification inside the instrument itself requiring a battery) and thus will require an external power source to play. The exceptions, of course, are four-string, three-string, two-string, one-string, and single-neck bass guitars which have their own power supply; these usually do not need equipment to be plugged into an outlet for use as a guitar, but may require accessories such as reeds or pickups that can add additional sounds to your sound. Active 6-String Guitars: These instruments have their own amplifier and effects loop built right in to the body. Many players prefer this type of guitar because it is more versatile than active bass guitars due to its ability to play both lead and rhythm parts. Active electric bassists rely on pedals like a tremelo bar for vibrato while most guitar amplifiers include options to provide various sounds with a tap tempo option.

"At least 100 bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a church that collapsed in the city of Uyo in south-eastern Nigeria on Saturday. The Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), a megachurch with branches around the world, was hosting an event at the time of the collapse. Eyewitnesses said a loud bang was heard and then the building began to shake before it crumbled to the ground. Rescue teams have been searching for survivors since the tragedy occurred, but many are still buried beneath the rubble. The Nigerian Red Cross has confirmed that at least 100 bodies have been recovered so far, though the exact number of casualties is still unknown. The cause of the collapse is currently under investigation, however local media has reported that illegal construction work may be to blame. The SCOAN is headed by Pastor T.B. Joshua, one of the most popular televangelists in Nigeria. He has yet to make a statement about the accident but has requested prayers for those who were affected. President Goodluck Jonathan has expressed his condolences and ordered an investigation into the tragedy. This is not the first time a building owned by SCOAN has collapsed in Uyo. In 2012, a guest house owned by the church fell down killing 86 people.

"The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close with a volley and the hosts should have been out of sight by half-time. The visitors had a few chances of their own, with Olivier Giroud bringing a save from Alisson, while Bukayo Saka forced the Brazilian into action early in the second period. But Liverpool were never seriously threatened and sealed the points late on when substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fired home from the edge of the box. It was an impressive display from Jurgen Klopp's side, who moved to within three points of the top four, and here are five things we learned from the game... 1. Liverpool show attacking intent The Reds showed plenty of attacking intent from the outset, as Origi and Firmino combined to open the scoring inside 15 minutes. The hosts had an array of chances to extend their lead throughout the first half, with Origi going close with a volley and Sadio Mane narrowly missing the target with a header. Klopp's side continued to push forward after the break, but it wasn't until the introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain that they finally found the third goal to seal the win.

"In a picturesque beach photoshoot, Andy Jordan, a former cast member of Made in Chelsea, has presented his new springsummer collection for his fashion brand, Jam Industries, in London, UK. After becoming a celebrity on a well-known reality TV program and being in a relationship with fellow cast member Louise Thompson, Andy has now established his identity in the fashion industry by introducing a collection of city wear inspired by the surfing culture. Wearing a range of outfits such as vibrant Hawaiian shirts, cozy loungewear, and trendy swim trunks, the 31-year-old business owner presented the latest collection. The collection's theme was perfectly highlighted in the photoshoot as Jordan posed in front of a beautiful beach background. Andy acknowledged in a previous interview that the beach lifestyle and his passion for surfing served as the motivation behind the establishment of Jam Industries in 2014. Together, Mark and him devised a concept of creating clothes suitable for urban areas as well as beaches. The concept behind the brand was to design a visual style suitable for both urban lifestyle and the surfing community. The clothing label has gained a reputation for delivering trendy and cozy garments that are suitable for different kinds of fashion tastes and events. Throughout time, Jam Industries has expanded past what was anticipated, building up a devoted group of followers and gaining the backing of former associates from his previous company, MIC. Apart from possessing the fashion label and showcasing his creations as a model, Andy has been dedicating his attention to his music profession. In 2015, he published an EP titled ""Another Night"" and has since presented at various events throughout the UK and Ireland. Although Andy Jordan has progressed significantly since his Made In Chelsea days, it is evident that his pursuits in fashion and music have allowed him to create a new direction for himself. It's understandable why supporters of the entrepreneur's style and innovation are eager to discover what other offerings he has in store, given the release of his most recent collection. Jam Industries has launched their new line of springsummer clothing, which can be purchased both online and in certain physical stores.

"One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work The Physics of Fire he established that the carbon from coal is converted into a gas when heated above 3200C, which was used to demonstrate that steam power could be achieved using fossil fuels such as coal that are not considered to have reached their 'limit' in terms of production rate at the time of writing (Taucher, 1977). Philo made this observation back in about 600 BC. It may seem like an obvious idea today since almost every household has a furnace or kiln - near it's roof there will be a burner where wood chips are burned, if you look carefully you can see small pores at the bottom of your chimney, these were broken up with a hammer and used for heating, but they would've still been burning coke for most people who lived in the Roman Empire. But at the time it wasn't clear what the combustion process actually did; he set out to prove that carbon in the form of charcoal was converted into gases and this led him to conclude how much heat energy was necessary for the conversion to take place. He didn't exactly do this experiment when he wrote, instead he used Egyptian pyramids to better understand the relationships between fire and water and the Egyptians had discovered that under specific conditions, the copper-rich, rusting surface of a copper plate, exposed over long periods of time, turns blue when it becomes too hot. This work paved the way for further investigation towards understanding why these chemicals react, and ultimately why we need heat to burn them. (Philo is also famous for being able to predict weather and seasons by measuring the temperatures of the Earth by conversing with one of its suns)",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b
"L'Auberge Espagnole cannot match the humor and intrigue of any episode from Dobie Gillis, despite the fact that Dobie Gillis was on television over sixty years ago. Despite the promising backdrop of a lively European setting and a talented ensemble cast, this French-Spanish co-production fails to deliver due to its weak plot and characters whose emotional struggles fail to strike a chord. The fundamental idea of a bunch of students from different countries residing together in Barcelona creates many opportunities for entertaining adventures and friendly relationships between different cultures. Nevertheless, it doesn't entirely meet its capabilities. There are a lot of overused xenophobic stereotypes being used and the humor falls flat, leaving the audience anticipating a punchline that never comes. Although Romain Duris displays potential in the main part, the uninspiring screenplay hinders his capacity to bring greater complexity to his character. Although he lives with a wide range of housemates, unfortunately, they do not fare well as most of them only exist to prolong exaggerated and artificial plots. The redeeming quality of the movie is its ability to showcase the attractiveness of Barcelona, including the stunning Gaudi buildings and the vibrant nightlife. The screen displays the energy and liveliness of the city, creating a stunning visual setting that surpasses the actual story. To put it briefly, L'Auberge Espagnole had the capability to be a laughter-inducing and thought-provoking journey into the experiences of an Erasmus student, dealing with cultural differences, confusion about identity and complicated relationships. On the contrary, it fails to impress by using typical jokes, uninteresting characters, and missed chances. This movie would have made a better and more memorable impact if it had the same charming and witty qualities as Dobie Gillis.",0,imdb_gpt4_para
"The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. ""There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,"" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. ""I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,"" he added. ""By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. ""The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. ""The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends."" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. ""Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,"" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. ""Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. ""They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence."" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no ""real forensic research has been done into that."" But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",1,xsum_human

"lettrine Lesion segmentation from the surrounding skin is the first task for developing automatic Computer-Aided Diagnosis of skin cancer. Variant features of lesion like uneven distribution of color, irregular shape, and varying texture make the segmentation task challenging. There are various methods developed for lesion segmentation such as thresholding, region-growing, edge detection, and machine learning-based approaches. Thresholding is a simple and easy-to-use technique where a threshold value is selected to separate the lesion from the surrounding skin. However, thresholding might not work well for lesions with complex textures or color variations. Region-growing is a technique that starts from a seed point inside the lesion and grows the region by adding adjacent pixels that have similar properties. This method can segment complex irregular shapes, but the selection of seed point can be crucial. Edge detection techniques segment lesions by detecting the boundaries between lesion and skin. However, this method may fail to segment textured or homogeneously colored lesions. Machine learning-based segmentation techniques use algorithms to learn from given training data and make predictions on new data. These techniques have shown promising results in lesion segmentation but require a significant amount of training data. Overall, lesion segmentation is a challenging task requiring expertise and specialized techniques.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_gpt-3.5-trubo
"Scientists at MIT have published a paper detailing a new type of artificial brain synapse that can potentially produce devices that can handle complex AI computing locally without having to rely on remote supercomputers. The paper, which was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, describes a new type of ""brain-inspired"" artificial synapse that has the potential to be used in AI devices to handle machine learning tasks. The researchers in charge of the study say that this new type of synapse will be able to match the complexity of the human brain, and even exceed it. The new synapse is able to adjust to its surroundings and determine the best possible action without relying on a remote supercomputer. The scientists say that this synapse can be used in devices that can handle artificial intelligence tasks more efficiently. The current model of AI is based on a supercomputer-like model where the central processor will analyze data coming in from sensors to determine a course of action. In the case of self-driving cars, a sensor will analyze the road ahead and send the data to a supercomputer that will calculate the best course of action. The problem with this model is that it requires a lot of processing power, and the connection between the sensors and the supercomputer is not a very efficient one. In the case of self-driving cars, the car will have to send a huge amount of data to the supercomputer, and this can slow down the car's reaction time. The new synapse that the researchers from MIT have developed can handle AI tasks in a more efficient way. The synapse can learn from its surroundings and decide on its own what action to take. This means that the AI device will not have to send data to a remote supercomputer for analysis and the process will be a lot faster. The synapse was tested on a computer device that could mimic the human brain. The device was able to classify data coming from the sensors, and it was able to adjust its own parameters to process data more efficiently. The researchers say that the synapse can be used in devices that can handle AI tasks with a high degree of accuracy. The team of scientists has already developed a prototype neural network that has the potential to handle complex AI tasks like facial recognition, and they are working on a larger network that can handle more complex tasks. The researchers believe that AI devices that are based on their new synapse will be able to do tasks more efficiently, and the AI devices will be able to use a smaller amount of energy. This could be a big advantage in cases where a lot of sensors are involved.",0,tldr_machine_continuation_13B

It is worth a lot more than that. How about ten dollars? A hundred dollars? Well, how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr. Jones' toy store? The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making. If the toy store is making 100 every day, that means it is making roughly 3,000 (30 days of 100) every month, or 36,000 every year (12 months of 3,000). Let's suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years. Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth 360,000 (which is 36,000 for ten years). Now, in practice this is a lot more complicated. But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame. Fortunately, we don't have to figure it out ourselves. There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth, and they do all of the hard work for us. They will tell us just how much Mr. Jones' toy store is really worth, and then we can decide to buy it or not. So, let's consider that the toy store is worth 360,000. If we want to buy it (and if he is willing to sell it), we can pay Mr. Jones that much money and now the toy store is ours! Now, this is all well and good if we have 360,000 and we want to own the entire company. But let's suppose we only have half that much, we have 180,000. What can we do now? Well, as long as Mr. Jones is willing, we can buy half of his company instead of the whole thing. This means that we will own 50 or half of the company, and he will own the other half. That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr. Jones, half will go to him and the other half to us. Another way of saying that we own 50 of the company is to say that we own 50 of the stock in a company. When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it, those pieces are called stock. There are two ways to think about stock: percentages, and shares. What we just talked about are percentages. We can buy 50 of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for 180,000. Similarly, we could buy 10 of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for 36,000 (assuming the total value of the company was 360,000), or we could buy 1 of the shares for 3,600, and so on. When you hear people talk about stocks, you will hear them talk about shares of stock. What exactly does this mean? Well, let's imagine that Mr. Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company. What he can do is say ""Hey everyone, I have 100 different pieces of my company for sale."" In this example, there are 100 total pieces he has for sale, each one being worth 1 of the stock. To buy all 100 pieces would cost you 360,000 and this would mean you own the entire company. This would mean that whenever the company makes money, you get all of the money. But let's suppose we only have 3,600 to use. This means all we can afford is one piece of his company, but that one piece is worth 1 which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars, we will get one dollar. So in this example, Mr. Jones' looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company, because each piece costs 3,600 which is a lot of money. So he decides rather than just have 100 pieces, or shares, he is going to have a thousand pieces! Now it takes ten shares to have 1 of the company, but each share is only 360. That is a lot more affordable. He could even decide to make 10,000 shares which means that you could buy a share for only 36. So this is the basic concept. Companies cut their value into pieces, or shares, and then sell the shares to people who will buy them. The people who buy shares are called ""investors"" and the act of buying a share is called ""investing."" This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid, because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makes. When a company is enormous, worth billions of dollars, even a thousand shares is simply not enough. They need to have many, many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable. Some companies have millions of shares of stock. Now, we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company. You are able to keep some of the money the company makes, based on how many shares you own. But when you own part of a company, you don't just get some of the money it makes. You also get to make decisions. Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next. The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have. Imagine that a company is owned by three people: Billy, Melissa, and James. Imagine that Billy owns 40 of the total shares, and that Melissa and James each own 30, which is less than what Billy owns. Let's suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy. Billy thinks it is a good idea, but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea. Well, even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company, and more voting power, he will still be out voted by both Melissa and James. This is because together Melissa and James have 60 compared to Billy's 40. When a company has a lot of share holders (people who own stock in the company), they will have meetings called shareholder meetings. In these meetings, everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own. The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decides. So then, this brings up a question. What if there are a lot of people who own shares, but one of them owns more than half of all the shares? Would that person be able to out-vote everyone else, no matter how many other people there are? The answer is yes. If a single person owns more than half of all the shares, then they have what is called ""controlling interest"" in the company. This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else. , ""I'm really surprised to see there's not a good answer on here yet.

The BBC's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims about cannibalism, was actually telling the truth. The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world (the Nile is the longest). It is 3,980 miles (6,400 kilometers) long. The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by discharge of water. It has a discharge of 208,000 cubic feet (5.9 million cubic meters) of water per second, which is more than all the world's other major rivers combined. The Amazon River has its origin in the Andes Mountains of Peru, but it flows north into the Atlantic Ocean. It takes the Amazon River 200 days to flow from the mountains to the sea. The Amazon Rainforest is one of the world's largest rainforests. The Amazon River passes through more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) of it. The Amazon Rainforest covers an area of 2.6 million square miles (6.7 million square kilometers), which is about the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River.

"BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent Kearney said it is possible the weapon was an AK47, which has previously been used in dissident republican attacks. Up to eight shots struck the passenger side of the car parked at Rossnareen Avenue, at about 18:50 GMT on Thursday. Two male officers who were in the car were not injured but were said to have been badly shaken. Police described it as a ""mindless, reckless attempt to kill officers."" Dissident republicans are being blamed. Ch Supt Nigel Grimshaw said the police car's armour-plating and bullet-proof glass had stopped the officers from being seriously injured or killed. Detectives believe the attackers made off in a BMW car that had been waiting nearby at Tullagh Park. The car, which was fitted with a false Republic of Ireland registration plate, was later found abandoned and on fire at Cluain Mor Drive in the Beechmount area. Police described the gun used in the attack as ""accurate firing."" One of the officers was looking through the passenger window when it was struck by two bullets.",1,xsum_human

"We do not know. We don't even know if the gas was dropped by the bombs or if the bombs hit chemical weapons on the ground that released its gas. We don't know why the US suddenly decided to bomb. There are several competing theories, from the obvious bullshit ""We are protecting civilians"" to the more realistic ""Trump wanted to show that he is the boss and can go against his advisors"" (apparently, his advisors told him that bombing Syria would be a very stupid idea). We don't know if the gas attack was real or staged. We don't know who did it. We don't know if the gas attack really happened or if it is a false flag. Even if the gas attack was real and the gas was dropped by the bombs, we don't know if the bombs were dropped by the US, Syria, Russia, or ISISAl-Qaeda (or any of the other terrorist groups backed by the US and the West). In 1939, the US supported the fascist coup in Spain, in order to overthrow a democratically elected leftist government. To justify their support of the fascists, they claimed that the Spanish leftists used chemical weapons against their own people. This claim was false and was proven to be false. The US has a long history of using false flag terrorist attacks in order to get what they want. They use false flag terrorist attacks to justify wars. I have no proof, but I am leaning towards the view that the gas attack was real and that the bombs that dropped the gas were dropped by ISISAl-Qaeda, in order to provide a pretext for the US to bomb Syria. I think that Trump's administration is filled with psychos and scumbags, but I don't think that they are stupid. The US has been attacking Syria for the last few years, and all they have to show for it is to have ruined the country and killed hundreds of thousands of people. In 2013, the US wanted to bomb Syria, but Russia and China blocked the attempt. Then, the US presented ""evidence"" of chemical weapons attacks, which were proven to be false. After that, they could not attack Syria. Assad has been around for a long time, so he knows how to play the game. He knows that the US won't accept that he is the legitimate president of Syria, but he also knows that the US won't go to war against him unless it is a false flag attack. He knows that he can't use chemical weapons and that, if he uses chemical weapons, the US will bomb him. I doubt that he would do something stupid and suicidal like using chemical weapons. And I really doubt that he would do it while the UN is investigating previous chemical weapons attacks. So, I think that Assad is not guilty of anything. I think that ISISAl-Qaeda is guilty of using chemical weapons and of having done so to provide a pretext for the US to bomb Syria. I don't know if Trump is doing this to look tough and show that he is the boss, or if he really believes that bombing Syria is a good idea. I don't think that this will lead to a full-scale invasion of Syria, but I do think that it will lead to more bombings. I also think that we are likely to see false flag terrorist attacks in the near future, that will be used to justify more bombings.

The restrictions that it does impose (barring utilities and disallowing recruiting) will be ineffectual because the NSA is large enough to work around these, operating and recruiting outside the state while still conducting surveillance within it.

"While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or ""standing"" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on ""direct effect"" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.",1,squad_human

Furthermore, the repair problem for a failed storage node in ORDSSes is under consideration and a tight lower bound on the repair bandwidth for each storage node is obtained. Particularly, we indicate the fact that for any ORDSS, every storage node can be repaired with repair bandwidth achieving the lower bound with equality.

"This paper investigates the linear precoder design for K -user interference channels of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers under finite alphabet inputs. We first obtain general explicit expressions of the achievable rate for users in the MIMO interference channel systems. We study optimal transmission strategies in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Given finite alphabet inputs, we show that a simple power allocation design achieves optimal performance at high SNR whereas the well-known interference alignment technique for Gaussian inputs only utilizes a partial interference-free signal space for transmission and leads to a constant rate loss when applied naively to finite-alphabet inputs. Moreover, we establish necessary conditions for the linear precoder design to achieve weighted sum-rate maximization. We also present an efficient iterative algorithm for determining precoding matrices of all the users. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed iterative algorithm achieves considerably higher sum-rate under practical QAM inputs than other known methods.",1,sci_gen_human

The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also, they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries. As far as service I would have expected something better from a place of Gordon's, that is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. We had to wait forever for refills and our waitress hardly checked back on us.... at least the food didn't have any problems that needed addressing.",1,yelp_human
"In Han government, the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-dan salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi ) - where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue - pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.",1,squad_human

"Chris was excited when he saw Tom's new computer. He decided to try it out. Although he didn't know how to use it, he kept clicking random buttons. When Tom tried getting him help, Chris made fun of him and told him that the computer wasn't working because he had no idea what he was doing! Later that day, Chris called Andrea at school (she was an English teacher) and said she needed to talk with her. She told her about what happened in his class. The next morning, they both went over their classroom schedules for the upcoming week. They agreed on a schedule based around work. As soon as everything settled down from Christmas break, the Principal asked them if they could take care of some extra duties - cleaning up after lunchroom tables etc... Since these were done so often without any problems, they thought nothing of this request. While walking into the office one afternoon, Chris noticed a note on one of the desks asking him not to clean anything else but tables again until further notice. He quickly changed and walked back outside only to find another desk and a similar message written across it. This time, however, there was no name mentioned anywhere except ""staff."" Chris wondered why nobody wanted to do something like that. After much consideration, he realized that maybe everyone did have someone who would refuse to do things such as this. That person probably wouldn't be either of them. Of course everybody knew whom the person was because Christopher always used the word staff everywhere, instead of teachers or other workers. Eventually, though, Chris came upon the same conclusion; Thomas was right all along but never let anybody see it. The next day, they both met in Mr. Blankenship's room where some papers were lying on a table near the entrance. Upon seeing them, they immediately opened them up realizing that they contained more information than just names. ""This is getting weird,"" Thomas remarked as he picked up an item that looked like a clipboard. It also held pages of old test scores. Both boys began reading through each page carefully but neither found anything strange yet. Right before closing up and leaving, Christopher asked his friend: ""What's our secret?"" Thomas simply replied by saying, ""You don't need a secret."" Besides knowing that answer already, Chris then remembered something he'd heard from Mrs. Truett once. One night while sitting together watching tv, a commercial came on informing people about a secret Santa program that would allow you to give away money anonymously. In response, the commercial showed pictures of families being given checks in amounts ranging from 50 to 100 million dollars. Inspired, the two friends decided to enter the competition and signed up online. The following Monday morning, when they arrived at school, they received the surprise news that they won first place nationwide. With excitement building inside, one thing led to another and within hours, they called every contact they possibly could think of. Finally, on Tuesday morning, they got really nervous waiting for a call from the Foundation which would accept their gift. The phone rang several times during the early part of the morning waiting for somebody to pick up. Finally, when 7:30 rolled around, the ring finally stopped. Immediately afterwards, Chris answered the door to see James standing there holding a newspaper. Seeing his face, Michaela ran upstairs yelling that he had good news too! ""We're going to Vegas!"" she screamed as she jumped onto her bed thinking of all the fun that awaited them. At 8am., Chris and Thomas woke up and packed their bags. Then, it was time to say goodbye to Jim Susan at school. On their way home via bus, Christopher talked about all the exciting things that were coming up including Valentine's Day parties, basketball tournaments, baseball games, and even a trip to Disney World. All of those plans fell apart though when suddenly he felt extremely tired and nauseated. He sat down beside the bench when he started feeling light-headed. A few minutes later, he fainted causing Mikey to get scared since he hadn't seen him pass out ever. Finally, after a couple of days passed, Chris' condition improved greatly and now all he remembers are the dreams he had and the voice telling him what to remember during the rest of his life.",0,roct_machine_continuation_opt_2.7b

"Glyph-based visualization is an effective tool for depicting multivariate information. Since sorting is one of the most common analytical tasks performed on individual attributes of a multi-dimensional data set, this motivates the hypothesis that introducing glyph sorting would significantly enhance the usability of glyph-based visualization. In this paper, we present a glyph-based conceptual framework as part of a visualization process for interactive sorting of multivariate data. We examine several technical aspects of glyph sorting and provide design principles for developing effective, visually sortable glyphs. Glyphs that are visually sortable provide two key benefits: 1) performing comparative analysis of multiple attributes between glyphs and 2) to support multi-dimensional visual search. We describe a system that incorporates focus and context glyphs to control sorting in a visually intuitive manner and for viewing sorted results in an Interactive, Multi-dimensional Glyph (IMG) plot that enables users to perform high-dimensional sorting, analyse and examine data trends in detail. To demonstrate the usability of glyph sorting, we present a case study in rugby event analysis for comparing and analysing trends within matches. This work is undertaken in conjunction with a national rugby team. From using glyph sorting, analysts have reported the discovery of new insight beyond traditional match analysis.",1,sci_gen_human

"It's not that they are at a disadvantage with natural resources, but rather the fact that other countries have exploited those resources. Many of the nations in Africa are mineral or oil rich, some even have a considerable potential for sustainable agriculture. However, because of imperialism and colonization, and the way Africa was split up by Europeans in previous centuries, Africans never really got to benefit from these resources. They were treated as slaves and much of the natural resources were taken, only for their profits to be shipped back to Europe. Also, nations in Africa are almost ""fake"" in the sense that their borders were drawn by the Europeans without consideration of the local tribes, religion and culture. This is why we here so much about civil and ethnic conflicts in Africa, even today. Because many African leaders were put into power of these unnatural countries they struggled to lead them and with only recent independence in the mid 1900s, they didn't have built up nations while the rest of the world had gone through another world war and was developing rapidly.

"If you have thoroughly explored all other films and have already examined every aspect of yourself and others, then this movie might be a good option to watch. The ""Mindless Journey"" scarcely manages to be memorable and falls short of being good in a clumsy manner. The unimpressive and overused storyline may make viewers wonder if there's a profound, obscure significance they have failed to grasp - but in truth, there isn't any. The flat and unimpressive characters in the movie provoke the question of whether the director handpicked them from a collection of the most uninteresting stock characters in existence. It's regrettable that the movie relies on cliche plot twists and familiar patterns, making it challenging to emotionally invest in the characters' outcomes. The quality of filming fluctuates from unimpressive to extremely overwhelming, which causes the audience to feel a little queasy in moments that could have been visually enjoyable. Unfortunately, ""Mindless Journey"" does not capitalize on any possible visual appeal. Perhaps the only positive aspect of this movie could be its diverse and captivating collection of music that may briefly divert the audience's attention from the chaotic and poorly constructed plot being presented on screen. Despite the presence of music, the film ultimately fails due to its unfulfilled potential, resulting in a dull and uninteresting experience. Ultimately, if you have explored all feasible forms of amusement and have come to the last resort of watching ""Mindless Journey,"" it would be beneficial for you to opt for an engaging book instead.

One of the officials from Buffalo Fire Department informed WGRZ that during the second explosion, a manhole cover was sent flying approximately 200 to 300 feet up in the air. While conducting an interview with a man on the street, a WGRZ photojournalist witnessed the second explosion happening approximately halfway down the street, causing a manhole to be propelled upwards.

"Olympique Lyonnais secured a 2-0 home victory against Bastia on Wednesday with goals from Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette in the second half, resulting in their rise to the top of Ligue 1. Substitute Yattara kicked the first goal at the 77th minute, and Lyon's leading scorer Lacazette increased his total score to 25, which helped move Lyon's total points to 64 after playing 32 games. Paris Saint-Germain, the current champions of France, are in second place and are two points behind the leading team with one outstanding match to play. Lyon emerged victorious over Bastia and both Alexandre Lacazette and Mohamed Yattara contributed by scoring goals. On Wednesday at the Stade de Gerland, Yattara, a striker from Guinea, scored the first goal against Bastia. Lyon were in control for the entirety of the game, but Bastia held them off for a while, still recovering from their loss of 4-0 to PSG in the League Cup final just last Saturday. In the sixth minute of the game, Jordan Ferri from Lyon skillfully maneuvered past a defender and took a curling shot, which was excellently prevented by Alphonse Areola. Once again, Areola displayed his skills by stopping Steed Malbranque's back heel on the 30-minute mark and rejecting Clinton Njie's low shot three minutes before the end of the first half, while Lyon remained in control. In the second half, Lacazette secured both the win and Lyon's leading position in the French Ligue 1. Lacazette, a French national, has scored 25 goals this season in Ligue 1, making him the highest scorer. In the 62nd minute, Malbranque was taken off and substituted by Clement Grenier, a France international who had been absent for eight months due to an injury. Nabil Fekir was not making his typical impact in the midfield for Lyon, and as a result, he was substituted in the 74th minute with Yattara. Yattara quickly made his presence known by scoring just three minutes after entering the game with a shot on the turn from Grenier's pass. Lacazette scored the winning goal from a short distance five minutes prior to the end of the game by successfully converting Njie's pass from the left side.",0,cnn_human_para
"On Saturday, the British Medical Association (BMA) announced it would be asking members in England about whether they wanted to take action. The dispute is over a new contract due to be introduced in August 2016. Critics say it could mean 15 pay cuts with ""normal hours"" re-classed as being from 7am to 10pm, Monday to Saturday. It means extra payments for unsociable working will only be given outside of these times, rather than the current arrangements of 7am to 7pm, Monday to Friday. News of the health secretary's intervention came on the day that a few thousand junior doctors held a protest in central London. The day's developments did not stop a few thousand junior doctors, some in hospital scrubs, gathering to protest at Westminster. They chanted ""BMA, BMA"" with the new chair of the association's junior doctors committee Dr Johann Malawana describing the gathering as probably unprecedented. Later they marched with their placards up Whitehall and for a time blocked the pavement and road outside the Department of Health. There is no doubt feelings are running high over the government's planned reforms to junior doctors' contracts. Much now rests on the planned meeting between Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Dr Malawana. The government has described the current contracts as ""outdated"" and ""unfair,"" pointing out they were introduced in the 1990s. Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012 but talks broke down last year. The government has indicated it will impose the new contract next year in England, prompting the BMA to ask its 53,000 junior doctor members about industrial action. But Mr Hunt has now offered the BMA junior doctors' leaders the opportunity to meet this week to see if they can find a solution to the dispute - the BMA has agreed to attend. Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which negotiates contracts on behalf of the government, said he hoped the meeting would bring the two sides closer. ""Our preferred position has always been to negotiate with the BMA."" Dr Johann Malawana, BMA junior doctor committee chairman, said his organisation ""has been clear about what it needs to hear from the government and NHS Employers to bring us back to the negotiating table.""

"The administration of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including novel disseisin and mort d'ancestor. These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating a new class of borough coroners. John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself. John continued to try relatively minor cases, even during military crises. Viewed positively, Lewis Warren considers that John discharged ""his royal duty of providing justice ... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted."" Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population. Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons, against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice.",1,squad_human

I've seen myself run down and devour children as their legs gave out from exhaustion. I've witnessed my body tear apart the helpless dying as they cry out for a savior. I've watched in wishful anticipation as a frightened man lifted his revolver to my head, only to be brought down from behind by an amorphous wave of undead arms. I've had to act as a bystander while my body acts contrary to everything that I held high as a human being. It's done things that will haunt me for the rest of my existence which, if one takes into consideration my being a phantom, could very well be forever. But you know what the worst part is, of all this? Of all the small crimes and grandiose horrors of having a front-row view to the ultimate torture? My fucking pants are down. Not at mid-thigh, not at my knees. They're at my ankles. I've been walking around for three months, dead, with my goddamn junk blowing in the wind. And you know what the worst part of that is? It's the reactions I see. I watch the faces of the doomed as they take in the initial horror of a rotund, yet surprisingly swift, zombie shambling towards them. And then I watch their face writhe in a second spate of horror as they notice my chubby, halfway-decomposed penis swaying lazily between my thighs, clapping and glooping about with my wrinkled, drooping testicles. Not only am I an undead scourge, feasting on the flesh of the innocent and the unfortunate; I'm an immortal walking punchline, shuffling about without the slightest bit of shame or remorse.

"Facial recognition software is a concern for privacy advocates due to its ability to identify people from a distance without their knowledge or consent, a power which has the potential to be abused by authorities. Some cities have banned the use of the technology by public officials and police. However, many citizens enjoy the benefits of facial recognition technology in their daily lives. Many summer camps are now using the technology to help parents keep an eye on their children when the children themselves don't have access to their phones. The children are usually unaware that they are being monitored. This technology has helped relieve separation anxiety from parents and also allows them to feel like they are not missing out on an important time in their children's lives. There are currently no laws to regulate facial recognition software, but the Federal Trade Commission is considering rules that would designate kids' faces as personal information, protected under federal law.",1,tldr_human
"My logic is pretty simple. People who believe that someone is selfish for committing or wanting to commit suicide just because it makes those around them sad then they are the true selfish ones because they care only for themselves and not the others who do commit suicide. I am not sure how long I have suffered from depression. I say suffer because it's not something you can just easily escape from. It's something you have to endure until you cannot anymore. I have been depressed and even suicidal at some point. I tried to kill myself 3 times before but I could not go through with it. I am not suicidal anymore and I don't think I will ever try to kill myself again because I am tired of hurting the ones I love. I used to blame my parents and I believe it is what caused me to be depressed but I now realize that it is not their fault. I had a lot of mental issues growing up. I was molested at the age of 8 by a family member. I did not know what was happening but I knew that it made me uncomfortable. I never told anyone because I was scared and I was made to feel ashamed of it. I was in grade 7 when I found out that I was adopted. I had been bullied growing up and I was always made to feel like I did not belong. I was so confused and had no idea what was going on. My mother would always yell at me and my father would never say anything. They had their own problems to deal with and I was just a child. I grew up so fast. I had to be the adult in the home. I grew up without knowing how to love myself. I had no self worth. I always felt ugly and I always felt like I was not good enough. I was never good enough. I always felt like a failure and I was never good enough. I felt like a burden. I can now see that I did not have the tools to deal with my pain. I would over eat and I would lose control over my food. I was always hungry and I always had cravings. I always felt out of control. My parents were always fighting. My mother would cry and my father would drink a lot. I always felt out of control. I would over exercise, I would drink excessively, I would cut, I would binge eat and I would restrict my food. I could never seem to get my shit together. I was diagnosed with depression when I was in high school. I was on anti-depressants and I was in counseling. I was lucky to have parents who could afford to send me to a private school. I was lucky because the teachers and counselors knew what I was going through and they helped me. I was lucky because my parents could afford to send me to a private psychologist. I was lucky because my parents put me on their work insurance plan. I was lucky because I had a place to stay. I was lucky because I had family and friends who loved and supported me. I was lucky because I had a caring and supportive husband. I was lucky because I had a beautiful baby boy. I was lucky because I was depressed. It could have been worse. I was lucky because I had the support I needed to get through it. I got lucky because I was always lucky. I was lucky because I could go through all of that pain and still come out on top. I was lucky because I always thought my life was so shitty but I was not alone. I was lucky because I had the courage to open up and I knew it was not my fault. I am not sure how it made me depressed but I have always known that being molested is wrong. I can't blame my parents because they had no idea. They were so young. I can't blame them for my issues. I am not sure how that happened but I don't believe I was ever truly happy. I don't think I ever felt like I was good enough or worthy. I always felt like I was a failure. I always felt like I was not enough. I always felt like I was not worthy. I always felt like I was not good enough. I always felt like I was not loved. I always felt like I had to do everything on my own. I had to be the strong one. I had to always fix everything. I always felt responsible for everyone. I always had to do everything. I was always the adult. I felt alone. I always felt alone. I always felt worthless. I was always in pain.

"Behavior planning is known to be one of the basic cognitive functions, which is essential for any cognitive architecture of any control system used in robotics. At the same time most of the widespread planning algorithms employed in those systems are developed using only approaches and models of Artificial Intelligence and don't take into account numerous results of cognitive experiments. As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control. One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g. symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, MAP, is utilized for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described. Preliminary experimental results are presented.",1,sci_gen_human

"1. I am 100 for gay marriage, and I personally do not care if it is called marriage. 2.

Therefore, I believe that changing the term for gay couples back to ""civil unions"" or anything else with ALL the same benefits as a marriage would solve many issues regarding protecting the sanctity of the word marriage and also would make it clear that you were gay (reduce awkwardness, etc.) EDIT: remember, personally or morally I do not think that gays should have to change their title for marriage but I DO believe it would solve many issues that are holding back gays from gaining widespread acceptance and would do more good than harm.",1,cmv_human

"Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that hasn't been removed from the mainstream in America - the genre has become a staple of American culture since the 1970s - but it certainly isn't dead yet. It should be noted there are many great rock bands who have proven themselves worthy of East Coast coverage when it comes time for them to play. Let""s start with the greatest hits. The Rolling Stones (The Rolling Stones) have just released their fifth studio album, The Rolling Stones: Live Under Night, which includes an extraordinary recording featuring Mick Jagger on vocals. This compilation features songs such as ""Abbie Hoffman"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" and their debut album Rock of Ages includes ""Backbreaker"" and ""You Aren."" The Stones also backslide into the modern world by releasing their own two albums - back in April 1998, for example, they were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album while touring internationally. These days, rock music is still slowly disappearing from the radar but the Stones continue unabated. A new album was recorded at the premiere of Guitar World Magazine's cover story headlined 'Rocks Are Coming!."" It follows the Stones as they toured around the globe performing shows ranging across Europe along with playing to audiences of all ages. It puts them among the most influential artists working today and is likely one of the most watched documentaries ever produced. The Stones remain popular people do enjoy listening to these performances even though there seems nothing resembling rock musicality anymore; listening now makes them sound like a rock band rather than a rock legend. Nothing gives me more joy than watching them perform live or coming home again after years apart because it feels like they're so much older than us mortals nowadays - not only does that make them sound old fashioned sounding slightly, we know they came through right away. In fact, they sound exactly like the way rock fans listen brilliant lyrics and catchy melodies to boot. Another documentary produced this year focuses on the beginnings of rock music in America. There is only one song that lives up to its title: ""Don't Look Back"" by Sister Rosario. Sister Rosario plays drums during concerts throughout the year including tours worldwide. The film centers around fellow New York native Wes Montgomery, who formed Sister Rosario at the age of 17 following her failed trip to America in 1986. He teamed up with drummer John Adams on his debut album Stop Making Sense. Sister Rosario remains some of the best known acts of rock history despite its obscurity due to its lacklustre beginning. Sister Rosario was nominated for Grammys last summer but fell short earning only three nominations - making it impossible for Sister Rosario to compete against the likes of The Rolling Stones. Hopefully they will gain recognition soon enough thanks to the success of their latest release. (see link below.) They recently announced that they will release their second album in 2020 titled Hold On The Moon which includes ""New York"" plus ""Stand By Me."" This time they bring back guitarist Rod Stewart whose last album was released seven years ago. Lonely Planet brings pop tunes alongside rock classics. With songs such as ""Gods You Know,"" ""Let"" and ""Can"" this DVD collection highlights the great artists of the 1960s including Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters and blues singer Stevie Wonder. The album includes singles such as ""Skyfall"" and ""Cold Cleaning."" The band emphasizes the simplicity of the music with vocals from Samuel Barbera and guitarist Steve Lukather adding to the fun atmosphere. Their debut albums are classics too including the incredible ""Sing It Again"" which features vocals from Sammy Davis Jr., Sly and the Family Stone and Ted Nugent. They tour extensively globally often concentrating on Europe but don't hold back any time soon.

"I guess I should have taken more notice when I saw the module entitled "" Death Ray: Effective Weapon or Superhero Bringer? "" But what do I know about modern business courses? Nothing, apparently. Now that I come to think of it, the lecturer, a Professor Ernie Vile, was a little eccentric. He once showed us five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. I did wonder just what I was getting myself into then. How irate could customers get? I only wanted to start a small photography business. Also, I would like to make it absolutely clear that I never went in there to become a supervillain. I honestly believed it was a business course right up until the League of Heroes burst through the door with their sting operation. I remember once we were asked to take in something in that would be a symbol of our trade. The Captain, he's the one with the cape, brought in a sort of gun to which he'd attached pipes filled with a blue liquid. He said it didn't work yet, but that it would truly revolutionise the world. I thought that was a little over the top. I mean, paintball is fun, but it's hardly revolutionary. Someone else brought in a crystal of some sort. It was kind of iridescent and emitted a faint humming noise. A bedside light designed to lull children to sleep, maybe? He wouldn't say where he got it, just that it was some sort of meteor remnant. He had a friend he always brought with him who carried everything for him and gave out stern looks if someone ever tried to contradict him. He had apparently been a loyal employee of Czar Dee Struction for years. What kind of parents name their kid Czar, anyway? Hippies, obviously. That also explained the fascination with crystals. For my part, I took in a camera because... Well, what else symbolises photography better than a camera? I remember when it was my turn to show it and everyone asked me, rather enthusiastically, what it did. Took pictures, I explained. This was met with some confusion. Did it evaporate people, Anne Archy asked. No, I explained. It was a camera. Did it hypnotise? I laughed. People did tend to become mesmerised when you were snapping photos of city buildings, yes. This seemed to satisfy them and afterwards I had a rather bizarre conversation with a hunched up man who suggested that a bright enough flash could be used to blind people. It was about six months later, and the professor had asked to see our progress with our various projects. I had brought in my camera, as usual, and a portfolio I had been working on. The hunched man came over and excitedly handed me a handheld flash. The captain had added some reservoirs to his gun for the strange water, and he said it presently only worked at short range, but he expected to have a fully working version in a few weeks. Czar had placed the crystal in a kind of metal box with a crude convex dish cut into one side. It reminded me of a square death star. He said that the dish amplified the effect of the crystal. I remember rolling my eyes at it. Just then, the door burst open and in jumped eight costumed men, in my shock I triggered the flash, and four of them dropped to their knees clutching at their eyes. One of them, The Gavel, or something, jumped over to me and got me in a headlock. The man was incredibly strong, and so I used number three of the five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. He tumbled to the floor and Czar pressed a button on his box. A ray of blue light shone out and knocked down Gavel and Mr. Truth. I saw then that the Captain, was having trouble with the guy in the pink leotard, and had dropped his paintball gun. I grabbed it with the intension of shooting him in the eyes, those paintballs could do some serious damage when up close, but instead the liquid streamed out and pink-leotard man just kind of... disintegrated. That was an utter shock, and probably about the time I realised this wasn't a common old garden business course.

"The movie ""Le conseguenze dell'amore"" (2004) is a meticulously crafted film that unfolds in small, deliberate stages towards its conclusion, which should be relished in order to fully appreciate it. The movie revolves around Titta Di Girolamo, a reclusive man with a troubling history, residing alone in a hotel, with Toni Servillo's mesmerizing acting serving as the centerpiece. Paolo Sorrentino, the director, skillfully crafts a mesmerizing and immersive ambiance that engulfs the audience in Titta's lonesome and enigmatic life. The film's intentional and slow tempo, akin to a leisurely dance, enables us to completely engage in its atmosphere and experience the protagonist's narrative's depth. The script gradually reveals a intricate plot, unraveling the depths of the personalities as we uncover the aftermath of their decisions, eventually compelling them to face their inner struggles. The way in which the cinematography portrays the surroundings is stunning, vividly capturing their beauty, sadness, and roughness in a poetic style. Additionally, the mesmerizingly exquisite musical score composed by Pasquale Catalano harmonizes with the somber and melancholic ambiance of the movie, flawlessly accentuating the emotional significance of the plot. The secondary actors give compelling portrayals, adding complexity to their roles and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The impact of Le conseguenze dell'amore goes beyond being a mere movie and instead offers a gradual unfolding of events that ultimately delivers a poignant and gratifying climax, making it a worthwhile experience for those willing to invest their time and attention. Sorrentino's exceptional ability as a filmmaker is highlighted in this captivating and intellectually stimulating masterpiece, which also serves as a stellar representation of Italian cinema. This is an excellent choice for people who enjoy a leisurely rhythm and intricate visual narration.",0,imdb_gpt4_para

"Video moment retrieval is to search the moment that is most relevant to the given natural language query. Existing methods are mostly trained in a fully-supervised setting, which requires the annotations of the exact starting and ending timestamps of the relevant moment in each video. However, the manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is a growing interest in unsupervised or weakly-supervised methods, which can learn to retrieve relevant moments without requiring such detailed annotations. These methods typically rely on some form of representation learning, which aims to capture the semantic meaning of the video and the query, and use this information to identify the relevant moment. Some common approaches include using pre-trained language and vision models, leveraging weak supervision signals such as video-level category labels, and incorporating contrastive learning to learn a joint representation of video and text.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_gpt-3.5-trubo

"While some people may view graduations from infant and primary schools as unnecessary or trivial, these events can have significant value for young students and their families. Graduations from these schools can provide an opportunity for students to celebrate their achievements, recognize their hard work and progress, and feel a sense of closure on one chapter of their education. By participating in graduations, students can also gain confidence, self-esteem, and a sense of accomplishment, which can be crucial in motivating them to continue with their education. Additionally, for families, graduation ceremonies can be a meaningful moment to see their children grow, and to feel proud of their children's accomplishments.

"The pug's face was bitten by a rattlesnake but he made a remarkable recovery. While hiking on the Jurupa Hills trail in Fontana, Canada, Dug and Lindsay Castro, his owner, became aware of a rattling noise on Thursday. Lindsay retreated, while Dug approached the reptile and faced the aftermath. Dug's face swelled to twice its original size immediately after the snake bit him on the face. You can view the video by scrolling down. Dug the pug's face doubled in size in a terrifying manner when he got bitten on the face by a rattlesnake. The inquisitive puppy went hiking with his owner and dashed towards a rattling noise - but he had to endure the consequences. Rushing against the clock, the duo hurried to the California Veterinary Specialist Hospital in Ontario and obtained a full dose of antidote for the venom. After getting continuous IV fluids and medical services for two full days, he is now prepared to leave for his home. Lindsay informed KTLA that she had believed her dog was lost. I felt very frightened. Lindsay Castro, the owner, was relieved to find out that she had not lost her pet as they were hastily taken to the hospital for treatment. Dug's neck underwent intensive antidote treatment, which greatly reduced swelling over the course of two days, resulting in less pain. Dug has had a difficult time lately since he was bitten during the early days of the rattlesnake season, causing him to feel despondent. Lindsay expressed her surprise upon seeing a reptile of enormous size jump out of the bushes in Fontana. The period of time when rattlesnakes can be found in Canada is between April and September. In a statement to KTLA, veterinarians who treated Dug cautioned other pet owners that animals do not possess the same sensitivities as humans when encountering a snake. Guidelines for dog walkers have been issued by Fontana Police, instructing individuals to keep their pets on a leash that is six feet long and to promptly seek medical attention in case of a snake bite.",0,cnn_human_para

"A lawyer will be able to make what you write in the will legally enforceable and clear in its meaning. If you are a layperson who is Googling what goes into a will it is likely that you will be using colloquial language that you think is obvious in its meaning, but legal rulings are based very much on precedent. By precedent I mean if a particular phrase was ruled to mean the same thing for the last 150 years then you can be very confident what it means when you use it. The problem is that phrasing is 150 years old and sounds antiquated, but it is better than your modern way of speaking which has no precedent.','English is a complicated language, and you want to be sure that everything in your will is 100 clear and without any shadow of a doubt, and you want to be sure that an objective third party with legal authority is aware of what everything means in order to settle any disputes. For example, if I said ""Give everything I own to my wife and kids,"" what does that mean? Who gets what percentage? Who gets the house? Who gets the car? Who gets the 15 on my desk? Who gets my desk? If I said ""Give my wife everything, and let her decide how to share it with the kids,"" what does that mean? Can she decide not to share anything with your children? Can she cut just one of them out completely? Your lawyer is there to think of everything for you. He's experienced in the matter, and knows what is likely to come up in court if something is called to question, and he can be called upon to be the arbiter of the will in the event something is questionable. It prevents long-lost relatives (like your drunk, meth addict second cousin) coming around and looking for handouts, and it ensures that everything is exactly how you wish it to be.', ""In addition to the answers you've gotten here, a lawyer can also help to identify concepts or options you may not be aware of and that a website might not mention. So, for instance, a lawyer might be able to flag when a trust would be more appropriate for what you want to do then simply giving money. Or they might know that you are in a state that allows for certain gimmicks in wills that other state's don't allow (like allowing you to create an easily editable list of where certain items will go that is referenced in the will, rather than needing to constantly change or update the will). Of course, if you're sufficiently motivated, you might be able to find out these things on your own, but the idea of the lawyer is that they don't just know the answers, but also what questions you should ask that you might not even realize that you need to ask.,TL;DR: You can spend a little money on a lawyer now, and save big later, or not spend money now, and possibly have to spend big later. I'm a lawyer. In most jurisdictions, there are only three requirements for a will to be considered ""legal."" (1) It must be in writing. (2) It must be signed by the testator (the person whose will it is). (3) It must be witnessed by a certain number of disinterested parties (the number depends on the jurisdiction). So, why can't you just make your own will? Short answer: You can. In fact, depending on your specific situation, a will may be complicating things unnecessarily. (That said, it's a good idea for most people). Then why should you consult a lawyer? Because even though those you only need those three requirements, there are nuances to it. For example, a lawyer can help you structure the will (through the use of trusts and other devices) to avoid taxes. Further, lawyers have to keep abreast of changes in the law. That is supposed to make us aware if, for example, a court has a ruling that would affect the way a will is construed, we should change the way we are drafting wills to take that into account. A lawyman may not know that, and if you are using a form from the internet, chances are it hasn't been updated. If there are problems in the will, chances are you will have to spend more money on a lawyer as the will goes through probate than you will have spent on a lawyer drafting the will to begin with.', ""An example of why you want lawyers involved in writing a will - someone I know got divorced shortly before they died. The divorce was amicable, and as he didn't have anyone else to leave his stuff to, he still wanted it to go to his ex-wife. His will stated that everything they had went to their'wife, [wife's name, so he figured it was fine and didn't change it. The probate court ruled that since the recently deceased did not have a wife anymore, the entire will was invalid. The estate was divided up based on state law, which said that his next of kin received everything, which was his kids. Legally his ex-wife wasn't entitled to anything at all. A good lawyer would have known how the probate court would interpret the will and had him change it to remove the word wife.,"" ""Wills estates go through probate court, so it's best to have them structured, worded, etc. in the proper way understood by the legalcourt system, to get your intentions across, particularly if you don't just want it to go to a spouse or evenly dividing among children. They will also know of issues that may arise due to lack of clarity (ie. you say all personal items are divided evenly among children.... but what's the process? Is it by value? Draft of items with them taking turns? Picking in what order? Or have you specified who gets what specific items?); you say trust money can pay for grandkids' college.... does that include culinary school, trade school, etc. or JUST a university? A lawyer can help get your intentions across in a legally enforceable way.,Every state has different ruleslaws and dependent on where you live and where you die you need your will to be able to hold up legally when you die.

"The matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely adopted for solving the rating prediction problem in recommender systems. The MF technique utilizes the latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors) and item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data. However, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of dynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time varying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that none of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual user preferences . Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization approach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent vector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a modified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent vector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear model for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our method on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the original MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to achieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real datasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is mostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent vectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and the Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the performance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20 and 5, respectively.",1,sci_gen_human
"Linear optimization is many times algorithmically simpler than non-linear convex optimization. Linear optimization over matroid polytopes, matching polytopes and path polytopes are example of problems for which we have simple and efficient combinatorial algorithms, but whose non-linear convex counterpart is harder and admit significantly less efficient algorithms. This motivates the computational model of convex optimization, including the offline, online and stochastic settings, using a linear optimization oracle. In this computational model we give several new results that improve over the previous state of the art. Our main result is a novel conditional gradient algorithm for smooth and strongly convex optimization over polyhedral sets that performs only a single linear optimization step over the domain on each iteration and enjoys a linear convergence rate. This gives an exponential improvement in convergence rate over previous results. Based on this new conditional gradient algorithm we give the first algorithms for online convex optimization over polyhedral sets that perform only a single linear optimization step over the domain while having optimal regret guarantees, answering an open question of . Our online algorithms also imply conditional gradient algorithms for non-smooth and stochastic convex optimization with the same convergence rates as projected (sub) gradient methods.",1,sci_gen_human

"Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.",1,squad_human

As he prepared his sleigh and gathered his presents, he couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. His team of elves had proven to be costly, and the rising cost of materials had taken a toll on his finances. He simply didn't have enough money to keep his workshop running.

"But there are about 500 deaths a year in the UK from cardiac arrest among the under-30s. When it happens it is shocking. Doubly so when it affects a sports star like 23-year-old Fabrice Muamba. He is said to be one of the fittest players at his club, Bolton Wanderers. The same sentiments were expressed about Marc-Vivien Foe, the Cameroon footballer who collapsed and died during an international match in 2003. But the underlying cause of such deaths are likely to be inherited rather than a reflection on their fitness. Genetic abnormalities are usually associated with arrhythmias - irregular heart beats - or cardiomyopathies, which is a disease of the heart muscle. But where sport can play a role is on the likelihood of these conditions leading to a cardiac arrest. The evidence is not clear-cut. But research has suggested that those with inherited conditions are twice as likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if they play sport at a high level. Dr Leonard Shapiro, a consultant cardiologist and medical adviser to the Football Association, says it is always difficult to know exactly what triggers the attack. But he says: ""There is a predisposition in some individuals to have a cardiac event under very high physical and emotional stress."" The question that is always asked after such events is whether anything can be done to prevent them. Many sports in Britain regularly screen top athletes, although it is not mandatory as it is in some countries such as Italy. In football, players are checked at 16 and then are likely to have regular check-ups as their career goes on. Those that are diagnosed with a problem often have to give up top-level sport. Sports cardiologist Sanjay Sharma, who also works for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, says the tests are thorough, but not perfect. ""It involves taking a history relating to cardiac symptoms, which include chest pain during exertion or breath which is disproportionate to the amount of exercise being performed, and blackouts, and asking about a family history because many of these conditions that can cause cardiac arrest are hereditary. ""We then perform a cardiac examination and following that we do an ECG (electrocardiogram), which is an electrical tracing of the heart which looks for electric faults of the heart, and a cardiac ultrasound, which looks at heart muscle problems or problems with the heart valves."" However, they do not guarantee that an abnormality will be picked up. The difficulty is that such abnormalities are not always permanent. They can come and go - as the Muamba case suggests. It has been reported that the Bolton player had four such screenings during his career, the latest of which was done last summer.",1,xsum_human

The two brothers lived with their mother for several years after their parents divorced in 1931 before Billy's father remarryed. Their affectionate relationship flourished until Billy was just 18 years old; William hadn't yet married. William died on July 9th 1956 at the age of 69. Billy's widow lived next door to Billy's parents until his funeral and Billy returned to work full-time last summer. In the days following William's death Billy worked part time at an agricultural cooperative called Brother Rice, which he started working there shortly afterward. He joined the Army in 1959 during World War II where he served three months fighting American forces near Aruba. He later moved to New Orleans where Billy attended LSU University for a year while studying marine biology. Billy became an Army veteran serving during World War II. His father encouraged Billy to stay active by guiding him through college exams and coaching him football games throughout football season. Billy graduated from LSU with degrees in history and economics early in 1960.

The two reptiles are among Australia's most threatened species. Because the federal environment minister failed to take into account what the mine could mean for their habitat, his earlier approval for the mine was overturned by the Federal Court of Australia. The mine may still go ahead but the delay is the latest chapter in a long history of Australian flora and fauna causing grief to developers. Back in 1995, one of the last known colonies of the endangered Green and Gold Bell frog delayed the construction of a multi-million dollar residential development in inner-city Sydney. A few years later, the frogs were found frolicking in an abandoned brick pit where authorities had planned to build a tennis court for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The courts were built elsewhere while the frogs got a specially built habitat. Now they are in the way of a key major road project in Sydney. In the mid 2000s, a new species of flowering shrub was discovered in the Lower Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. Named Persoonia pauciflora, botanists were excited to discover it grew nowhere else in the world. Unfortunately, it was growing on the site of a proposed housing development. When word got around, someone ripped out 300 of the last 500 of these rare plants. The culprit was never found. The discovery of a threatened or new species can cause havoc for developers, delaying or even putting an end to a project. What overturned the Queensland mine's approval? A small conservation group in Mackay, Queensland, challenged the environment minister's decision to approve the mine on a number of legal bases, including: Approved Conservation Advices are scientific and legal documents that explain the conservation requirements of species to avoid their extinction. It was this last point that convinced the court to overturn the minister's approval. In the state of Victoria, the Orange-bellied Parrot was centre stage in a long-running saga about whether a wind farm could be built in South Gippsland. The federal environment minister banned the 52-turbine project in 2006, on advice that turbine blades posed a small risk to the critically endangered bird. The minister eventually reversed his own decision and the wind farm is going ahead. In the case of Indian company Adani's giant coal mine in Queensland, environmentalists and scientists are worried about more than threats to reptiles. Dredging associated with an expansion of port facilities for the mine poses a huge risk to the Great Barrier Reef; exports would further entrench the world's reliance on carbon polluting fossil fuels; and the mine could threaten artesian water. The Department of the Environment on Wednesday said reconsideration of the project did not require revisiting the entire approval process. New approval documentation could be ready within eight weeks. Adani described the court decision as simply a ""technical legal error."" But environmentalists say protecting endangered species is vital work. ""To describe an endangered species as a technicality and groundwater as a technicality is in line with Adani's environmental record around the world, which is appalling,"" said Geoff Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. ""The government should simply strike this project down.""",1,xsum_human

You like the woods especially in October. The air feels just right and the leaves as they fall around you are an unforgettable sight.

This was a mistake the route was boring and all the leaves had already fallen leaving a red and orange carpet for winter to come and cover up. You could deal with all of this though and the mediocre jog you got out of it but what really annoys you is the path being covered up and you getting lost in the middle of the woods. The cold was getting to you and you began to get irritable pull roughly the head phones from your ears hurting your ear cannel annoying you even more. You hear something in the woods great lumbering breaths and the piteous moan of something humongous. You get low to the ground you had hear of bears doing this to scare away smaller predators and you didn't intend to be killed by a bear today. That all changed as you turned and saw it. You in your shock try to understand how you didn't notice it before. A whale lay their belly to the sky as it gasped and groaned into the open air. The massive bulk continued to breath as the heater on its skin froze slowly. It moved side to side as it died in the open sun. You leave where you to stand to walk up to its face. The eye that looks at you is old and tired and as you understand this creature is dying in some mysterious circumstance you sat down next to it giving what ever comfort you can to the poor creature as it froze to death far away from home. As it breaths your last and you stand up to walk away. You turn to look at it one last time finding to your surprise that it had disappeared. You hadn't called your family in a while and maybe you'll take the day off to visit them. You walked away leaving a creator behind you and the life of a great beast that may or may not have been real to where ever lives so old go.,1,wp_human

"Consider the problem of sampling sequentially from a finite number of N 2 populations, specified by random variables X I k, I 1, ..., N, and k 1, 2, ...; To sample sequentially from a finite number of N populations, you can use the following steps: 1. Identify the N populations and their corresponding random variables XIk. 2. Decide on the sample size n that you want to draw from each population. 3. Randomly select the first sample of size n from the first population (I1). 4. Calculate the sample mean and variance of this first sample. 5. Use the sample mean and variance to determine the appropriate sample size for the second population (I2), based on desired level of confidence and statistical power. 6. Randomly select the second sample of size n, using the determined sample size and appropriate sampling method (e.g. simple random sampling). 7. Repeat steps 4-6 for populations I3, 4,...,N, using the sample mean and variance from the previous sample to determine the appropriate sample size for the next population. Note that this method assumes that the populations are independent and identically distributed (iid), and that the samples are drawn with replacement.

"There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, and their relationship to one another, can be extrapolated into a common element, number 2. 2 Universe The universe consists of two parts: 3 main elements Each part contains an integral component [0]. The integral dimension represents the difference in length between any nodes on the same plane. A fourth element The fourth element has its own unique aspect (or twist) called a regular component (for example, a cylinder, an atom or whatever). It has some basic structure identical to a regular element for all other elements though. Thus the figure of 1 0 points is the polynomial equivalent of the polynomial of 2 0 points if there is no complete set of periodic values (the dimension of a point reduces to zero or more, unless it exists at a particular precision). An alternative rule about ordinary matter is that non-zero quantum quantities are independent from each other, which allows us to derive the decomposition of groups of special units into discrete functions. This is achieved with Fractional integration of finite parameters. Note that only elements equal to 1 are finite when they have equal ""normal"" dimensions corresponding to both the quartile standard and the sum of regular dimensions. If we explore the case where the inverse of the node size is local to the geometry, then the conventional wisdom would say that instead of adding 14th of a second to the square root of the density, the oddness of the radius should be greater than -1. Therefore an abstract solution to this problem claims that in order to obtain an infinite number of such components, these ordered classes must be replaced and replace together with the usual transformation of f (t), d (x) t (z) dt. As mentioned above, this transformation is not a function of the geometry itself, but rather of the properties of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule. However, this doesn't explain how a directional density gradient, or a series of 1010 pairs, can exist between 0 and 5 other components. By assuming that 2 4 and 5 6, a surface area of 0.5 x 30 cm2 (with a material density of 150 gs) defines a gradient of 0.8 100 cm2. Hence, the net effect of this calculation would be 0.7 1020cm2 as shown below. This contrast to the general form of the power differential equation, explains why in our most recent work we measure the diameter of the earth's crust by measuring long lengths of circular particles (e.g., solar headed cosmic rays).",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_125m

"I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them. I have also read a lot of opinions on this topic by the sceptics. My conclusion is that while NDEs are not a 100 bulletproof evidence for the existence of afterlife (by afterlife, I refer to the possibility, that a certain part of personal consciousness can exist after bodily death), I still think that there is enough evidence, that such option should be considered very seriously by the mainstream science. As evidence, I consider 1) frequent reports of psychic phenomena during NDE (sceptics seem usually to ignore that, or simply say it's not reproducible or trustworthy) 2) similarly - patients having NDE being able to describe details of surgeries that happened while thay had no brain activity 3) people who had NDEs are usually completely convinced that the experince was real and believe in afterlife, reagardless of previous beliefs (sceptics simply say thatm they're deluded, which seems rather closed-minded, even smug, to me) 4) similarly - people who had NDEs often change their lives in some way and attribute that to the contents of the experince. (probably does not logically imply much, but it's still worth considering imho). Further, it seems to me, that the sceptics failed to provide a resonable alternative explanation. Usually, they just dismiss it saying ""it's just hallucination of the dying brain"" or ""fraud,"" but never elaborate on the details of such claims. Please, don't try to CMV on the validity of NDEs, but try to CMV that mainstream science is ignorant of the available evidence and that the sceptics are rather closed-minded. Or alternatively explain why all the evidence available is actually not enough to consider this possibility scientificaly interesting and disbelief should be pushed as the ""default"" opinion in science as it seems to me to be the case now.

"Once upon a time there lived a brave knight named Sir Thomas. He had been a loyal and honourable member of the kingdom for many years and was well-known for his courage and valour in battle. One day, King Arthur summoned Sir Thomas to his court and informed him that a dragon had been terrorizing the kingdom and it was up to him to slay it. The king bestowed upon him the Sword of Truth and gave him his blessing to carry out this noble quest. Sir Thomas set off on his mission full of courage and determination. After days of searching, he finally located the dragon's lair. As he entered the cave, however, he was shocked to discover that the dragon was none other than his beloved wife, Lady Margaret. Sir Thomas couldn't bring himself to raise his sword against her, so instead he pleaded with her to turn away from her evil ways and return to the kingdom with him. Much to his surprise, Lady Margaret accepted his plea and agreed to come back with him. The two returned to the kingdom together and were greeted with great joy by all. King Arthur, who had secretly been watching from afar, couldn't have been more pleased. He thanked Sir Thomas for his brave deed and praised him for bringing his beloved back to him.

"The Victorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects. Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to its current home on Trafalgar Square: at this point an extension had been added and a grand staircase built. The museum's European antiques collection became so large during World War II several sections were closed for refurbishment; this included three galleries dedicated entirely to English art. During Sir George Gilbert Scott designed new premises across from Buckingham Palace, which opened as Victoria Albert Museum (VA) on 9 December 1951 following extensive renovations. VA facilities also include the largest exhibition hall space in Europe at 24,000 square metres. Architecture The setting is Gothic Revival designed by William Kingdon Wood, who attended university here before joining Benjamin Rowland Taylor Hutton - he oversaw all his works, including London's City Hall, Bank of England, St Paul's Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey. In order to create a ""compact"" interior, only two fireplaces were permitted per floor while mid-height windows allowed free circulation upstairs. A pair of columns flank each landing, serving both decorative purposes and contributing support under pressure from heavy objects such as paintings Additions are grouped around these central elements, beginning with 1442 when the Chapel was completed near where Scottish Highlands House now stands. During Queen Mary commissioned Charles Barry to build the Grand Gallery, one of the most significant buildings outside Scotland or Ireland. It forms part of Wolverton Court on what is now Her Majesty's 10 Downing Street residence, between Hyde Park Corner and Whitehall Bridge. Two other major extensions followed, the first was Thomas Henry Bickerton's creation of Mrs Simpson's Room in 1870, intended more for display than storage and furnished thereon completion by Edward Burne-Jones' mythological sculpture, ""The Marriage of Eurydice"" (1882: painted by John Gorton Tenniel). In 1902 Cecil Beaton gave Mrs Rothschild her own room decorated by Arthur Conan Doyle. John Nash adapted a design of Italianate architecture from the late 19th century, using brickwork and stone dressings to recreate classical influence within modernist surroundings. This plan survives vigorously today, retaining a classical facade despite seismic damage caused by the 1906 earthquake and subsequent alterations. One end of the ground-floor corridor has retained much intact original decoration throughout the 20th century. Many buildings of Arts and Crafts origin still survive but they too underwent reconstruction after the Great Fire. Each section has been extensively restored since the early 1960s except those associated with the Irish railway system constructed in 1898. Renovations started in 1999. From 2008 until 2013 the building underwent a 280million redevelopment project led by David Chipperfield Architects. Some of the structural changes made during the restoration work involved retrofitting wooden balconies and replacing steel floors with concrete slabs below grade level. These measures enabled removal of some curtain walls without compromising historic integrity. After being acquired by the Crown Estate, the nearby Royal Festival Hall was demolished to make way for developments surrounding the 1 billion Queen's Theatre. Around 15 months ago, plans emerged to sell off the National Portrait Gallery onto private investors, due to uncertainty over future funding. However, talks broke down because the buyer refused to pay 6 million pounds required for repayment of money previously loaned out by government. Since then, Philippa Ogden-Grant has taken up Prince Andrew's role as executive director of the institution. Collections There are about 11.5 million items held in the collections.

Researchers have determined that the egg came from a massive aquatic reptile, which would have been a cross between a plesiosaur and a mosasaur. The fossilized egg was about the size of a small car. The new fossil is the first discovery of a fossilized egg in Antarctica. Researchers are saying that it proves that Antarctica was once a very wet place. The researchers are studying the fossilized egg to see if they can determine how the reptile laid its eggs. They are also looking to see if they can determine what type of reptile it was. Some of the eggs found in Antarctica are believed to be from the giant marine reptiles. Other eggs were believed to be from the dinosaurian reptiles. It is not clear if this fossil is from a marine reptile or a dinosaurian reptile. Researchers have discovered a fossilized 14-inch-long egg in Antarctica. They believe that the egg is from a giant marine reptile that lived 125 million years ago. They believe that the egg is from a species that was a cross between a plesiosaur and a mosasaur.

"Humans flexibly solve new problems that differ qualitatively from those they were trained on. This ability to generalize is supported by learned concepts that capture structure common across different problems. Here we develop a naturalistic drawing task to study how humans rapidly acquire structured prior knowledge. The task requires drawing visual objects that share underlying structure, based on a set of composable geometric rules. We show that people spontaneously learn abstract drawing procedures that support generalization, and propose a model of how learners can discover these reusable drawing programs. Trained in the same setting as humans, and constrained to produce efficient motor actions, this model discovers new drawing routines that transfer to test objects and resemble learned features of human sequences. These results suggest that two principles guiding motor program induction in the model - abstraction (general programs that ignore object-specific details) and compositionality (recombining previously learned programs) - are key for explaining how humans learn structured internal representations that guide flexible reasoning and learning.",1,sci_gen_human

"The main thing to keep in mind is that most reporting on the trial hasn't been done by people who were there the entire time. Sure, lots of reporters may have been.... but then lots of other reporters just read those reports to make their own. The defense attorneys had a big advantage in this case. All they had to do was raise doubt in the jurors mind. The prosecutors had an uphill battle, but they had to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. What this comes down to, day in and day out at trial, is narrative. The prosecutors come up with a story. They sell that story every day. The defense team does best when they offer a competing story, their own narrative. But Hernandez's team took a different approach. They basically gave away their advantage. Instead of offering a single, more compelling alternative to the prosecution's claim they just tried to poke holes in it piecemeal.... changing approaches and tactics several times. And ultimately the defense team couldn't offer a complelling alternative for Hernandez's behavior during the killing and afterwards. Things he said, things that were done, that sort of thing. The jury decided that, instead of a string of unlikely coincidences that just happened to make it look really bad, it was more likely that Hernandez just killed him and tried to hide it afterwards.

"The mixing time of a graph is an important metric, which is not only useful in analyzing connectivity and expansion properties of the network, but also serves as a key parameter in designing efficient algorithms. We introduce a new notion of mixing of a random walk on a (undirected) graph, called local mixing . Informally, the local mixing with respect to a given node s , is the mixing of a random walk probability distribution restricted to a large enough subset of nodes - say, a subset of size at least n for a given parameter - containing s . The time to mix over such a subset by a random walk starting from a source node s is called the local mixing time with respect to s . The local mixing time captures the local connectivity and expansion properties around a given source node and is a useful parameter that determines the running time of algorithms for partial information spreading, gossip etc. Our first contribution is formally defining the notion of local mixing time in an undirected graph. We then present an efficient distributed algorithm which computes a constant factor approximation to the local mixing time with respect to a source node s in O ( s) rounds 1 footnote 1 Footnote Footnote Footnotes Footnotes 1 footnote 1 The notation O hides a O (polylog n) factor. , where s is the local mixing time w.r.t s in an n -node regular graph. This bound holds when s is significantly smaller than the conductance of the local mixing set (i.e., the set where the walk mixes locally); this is typically the interesting case where the local mixing time is significantly smaller than the mixing time (with respect to s). We also present a distributed algorithm that computes the exact local mixing time in O ( s D) rounds, where D min { s , D } and D is the diameter of the graph (this bound holds unconditionally without any assumptions on s). Our algorithms work in the CONGEST model of distributed computing. Since the local mixing time can be significantly smaller than the mixing time (or even the diameter) in many graphs, it serves as a tighter measure of distributed complexity in certain algorithmic applications. In particular, we show that local mixing time tightly characterizes the complexity of partial information spreading which in turn is useful in solving other problems such as the maximum coverage problem, full information spreading, leader election etc.",1,sci_gen_human

"There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree from a university or college on a student who has completed a course of study, and has been admitted to membership in a particular profession. However, the concept of a graduation for a 7 year old is a recent one and not always popular. Graduation ceremonies can be very expensive as each pupil has to be presented with a scroll and a certificate. If there are a large number of pupils graduating, the cost of the scrolls and certificates can quickly add up. The children may be 'graduating' from infant school or primary school. The ceremony can be held at the school where the children attend or at a location of their parents choosing. It can be a 'graduation' ceremony for a number of years at the school or simply for a particular year. This ceremony can be held in the morning and before the school day starts. A group of children, who are in the same year at school, are presented with a certificate. The children are not given a scroll, which is quite a costly item. The certificate can be of any size, but should be of a similar size to a certificate for a GCSE. The certificate does not have to be 'pretty' and can be very simple. The certificate should include the children's name, the year they are leaving and a message from the head teacher. The certificate can include any other wording which parents wish to include. The certificates should be presented to the children on the day of the ceremony. The certificates should be in envelopes and can be presented to the children by a member of staff, or a guest, or the children can be presented with them by their parents. The children may be awarded a certificate for completing a particular course at school, for example, learning to read, learning to write, learning to count or learning to play a musical instrument. The certificate could also be awarded for a particular achievement by the child, such as being a good friend, a good child or for good behaviour. The certificate could also be awarded for the child learning a particular skill, for example, how to ride a bike, how to swim or how to ride a horse. The certificate can be awarded for a variety of reasons, but it is important that the certificate is an appropriate size and the wording on it is suitable for the occasion. The certificate should be given to the child on the day of the ceremony. The certificate does not have to be in an envelope and can be presented by a member of staff, or a guest, or the child's parents. The certificate should be presented to the child at the ceremony by a member of staff or a guest. The certificate should be in an envelope, which is sealed with a red wax seal. The envelope should be presented to the child by a member of staff. The envelope can be presented to the child by a guest or the child's parents. The envelope should be opened in front of all the parents at the ceremony. The envelope should not be opened before the ceremony. The envelope should be opened by a member of staff, or a guest, or the child's parents. The envelope should be opened in front of all the parents. A scroll is a long piece of parchment with a message written on it, which is rolled up and tied with a ribbon or string. The scroll can be made from any paper or parchment, but the most common paper is vellum. Vellum is a very strong paper made from calf skin. It is commonly used for making very long documents, such as parchment certificates and diplomas. A scroll is most commonly used at universities and colleges to award degrees to students who have completed a course of study. Vellum is a very expensive material to use, but it is traditional and the style of scroll can be traditional or modern. The scroll can be made to measure. The scroll should be made large enough to contain the message and the ribbon should be long enough to tie a bow. The message should be in capital letters and written neatly on the scroll. The message should include the child's name, the year they are leaving and a message from the head teacher. The message should be written by hand. The message should be written in block capitals. The message should be written in black ink. The scroll should be in a padded envelope and sent to the address of the parents. The padded envelope should be in the same",0,cmv_machine_continuation_7B

"Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit less ridiculous than Y. 2. What it means. The phrase X is not just an expression of incredulity; it's also a suggestion that Y may not be the best solution. 3. How you say it. You're not just saying X, you're saying it with authority. 4. How it's understood. People don't take you seriously when you say Y, because they don't believe you're suggesting that it's a good idea. 5. The power of suggestion. People might say, ""Yes, but what about Y?"" You could be right, but that's not what you said. You said X, and you're suggesting that Y is bad. This power of suggestion is even stronger if you add in the phrasing ""that's a good idea"" at the end. 6. It's a shorter phrase. People remember longer phrases more easily than shorter phrases. This is especially true when those longer phrases include the word ""but."" 7. It's more original. When people hear X, they think of other things that they've heard people say. When they hear Y, they think of other things they've heard people say. 8. It's not used as often. It's less common to hear people say Y than it is to hear people say X. This means that Y sounds more contrived and less believable. 9. It's more memorable. If you want people to remember your idea, you want to say something that they can remember. It's more memorable to say X than it is to say Y. 10. You can do it in two syllables. Y is four syllables. If you can do it in two syllables, you're one step closer to making your idea sound more credible. 11. It's more original. The words X and Y are so close in sound and meaning that the phrase X is a more original idea than Y. This makes it more likely that people will take your idea seriously. 12. It's easier to say. The words X are easier to say than Y. This makes it easier for people to say your idea. 13. It's more specific. When you say X, you're saying that you have a specific idea. When you say Y, you're saying that you have a general idea. People are more likely to take a specific idea seriously than a general idea. 14. It's a bit of humor. It's easy to laugh at a ridiculous idea. People are more likely to laugh at a ridiculous idea when it's attached to the phrase X than when it's attached to the phrase Y. 15. It's less likely to be taken literally. When you say X, you're making a suggestion. When you say Y, you're stating a fact. People are more likely to take a suggestion seriously than a fact. 16. It's more authoritative. When you say X, you're saying that you're an authority on the topic. When you say Y, you're saying that you're just a normal person who had an idea. People are more likely to take an authority figure seriously than a normal person. 17. It's a snappy phrase. People like short, snappy phrases. When you say X, you're saying that your idea is a snappy phrase. When you say Y, you're saying that your idea is not a snappy phrase. People are more likely to take a snappy phrase seriously than a not-snappy phrase. 18. It's more powerful. When you say X, you're saying that your idea is powerful. When you say Y, you're saying that your idea is not powerful. People are more likely to take a powerful idea seriously than a less powerful idea. 19. It's less likely to be taken seriously. When you say X, you're making a suggestion. When you say Y, you're stating a fact. People are more likely to take a suggestion seriously than a fact. 20. It's a lot more specific. When you say X, you're saying that your idea is very specific. When you say Y, you're saying that your idea is not very specific. People are more likely to take a very specific idea seriously than a less specific idea. 21. It's more likely to be taken seriously.

"I blinked again. She still stood there in her brown coat, soot had blemished the arm and torso part of it. Her wrinkled eyes looking at me with a penetrating look behind a pair of thick out-of-date style cheap glasses. ""What did you mean by ""You heard me once. Don't play deaf."" Her crisp voice cut my sentence off. ""She is a master of trickery. You gave her that power."" I knew I creased my eyebrows so hard that it made her look softened a bit. ""5 months eh?"" Since I started my dreams? I nodded as a confirmation. ""I have been trying to tell you about her, but you couldn't hear me. I figured that she had me blocked from your awareness."" The old lady now conjured a tray of small half egg shaped crystal cups filled with clear golden liquid. She laid it on a table between us both. ""Drink."" I picked up one of the cups, a solid milky one with green circle stone ornaments etched around its midst. And without protesting drank the liquid at one gulp. At once I felt an excruciating pain exploded from my forehead. I remembered that I fell into a sliding tunnel. Then felt the end of tunnel opened into a total nothingness that had me blanketed in dense chill fog. I cried and screamed in fear, tried to move but again I realised I didn't have a body to do it, around me the thick mist of white prevented my sight to see clearly. When my breath finally slowed down, I could a see two figures loomed above my face. ""She just lie there like a pig."" ""A statue more likely."" ""Or a vase?"" I raised my hands to reach them but I had no energy left. Only a bit of awareness to see I was back in my body again. So I strained my eyes to see them more clearly and the mist started to lift. I saw the shabby old lady and my familiar future self that had been mentoring me the past few months, both were standing side by side like lab scientists measuring their research object. In one look I realised they both were the same lady, with the same apparel just with different physical look. My mentor was a shiny beautiful woman, with glowing face and hair looking like being freshly styled by a professional born-to-be hair dresser, her slim and fit body was wrapped with a glorious looking brown leather coat, tailored with quality looking material. Her dress was embroidered with golden threads with perfect circle of precious stone beads etched on each curve. Her feet were wrapped with tight brown leather boots accentuated with bronze and brass. And the other woman.... I paused my mind. The old lady addressed my critical look with open mirth. She was daring me to judge her style. Similar face but more wrinkles, and uses glasses. She has a more intense pair of eyes though. Greying strands of hair, ordinary hair style, brown shabby coat, plain dress, brown boots.... That were all the points that my mind dared to address. ""Why ?"" ""Are you bothered by the difference between me and her?"" I nodded. ""What is it exactly that bothers you?"" ""Are you..... my future too ?"" Suddenly my mentor laughed and stopped my question with her derisive snort. ""Quit playing the victim game. I have taught you enough."" Huh? ""You don't want to feel guilty for what you are doing to her, do you?"" I felt my right chest burst into hot rage. ""What do you mean? I don't play victim! What did I do to her? I didn't know anything abo ""You don't want to hear what you know,"" she replied icily. And then a softer voice followed, ""You didn't try hard enough."" I started to feel faint and a seed of doubt inside me suddenly grew. ""I listened to what you said! Like all the steps you've told me to do!"" I shouted back. ""Yea, that's because my job is giving you the easy ones! And you didn't even think why you should follow my advices besides the fact they were easy."" My head spun, and then I looked at the old lady. She had a thin smile on her lips. ""Enough."" This made my mentor stopped talking and turned her head to face her counterpart. ""I think we all can see that your mentorship actually helped her to see that she's not going anywhere anytime soon."" With a chuckle she flicked her fingers and a window opened on the right side of the room. ""That is her dream destination. But what you were doing,"" she nodded at me, ""is gon na make you end there,"" she pointed to the other side of the room where a TV was showing a global event where the flood and storm was wrecking havoc in a northern state. ""With the speed of your unconscious actions, the domino effect of your doing will play back on you like that."" What does that have anything to do with me? I asked with fear creeping up. ""Everything in this life is interconnected. When you choose to do something without awareness, that action will comeback to you, whether you like it or not. It will be in any form. Not necessarily apple to apple. But it can be guilt, it can be shame, it can be depressing news, or a fruitful return."" She paused to regard me with her pair of witty eyes. They were more compassionate and warmer now. ""You have to know that you are held responsible for every action you do, but you can't play small because of it."" Sure why would I play small? I objected with a weak smile, while a shameful feeling grew to replace fear. ""Because you only do what feels comfortable for you!"" My mentor chimed in with an utter disgust look on her face. I felt my face hot with embarrassment. ""Well you have been helpful weren't you? Toying with me, and now throw everything back at me with the intention to humiliate me!"" ""Only you who can let me humiliate you. Only you who can let me toy with you."" I cried in anger and jumped to my feet to attack her. My mentor slid away from my punches easily. The old lady was looking at our antiquities without being perturbed, she even conjured another tray now filled with baked red velvet cake slices, a hot tea pot and several pink and yellow tea cups. Then she poured tea on one of the yellow cups while both me and my mentor were playing cat fight. I woke up covered with sweats. My heart still raced as my memory replayed the last scene where I finally caught my mentor's hair and pulled her into my claws. I stayed still, focusing on my breath and my dream. What the hell..... I shut my eyes again and felt a rush of tingling warmth moved from my lower back up to my crown. Then a breeze of air passed by the side of my ear. It reminded me that I was safe. The sun just set and my digital clock showed three passed seven on it. I decided to put everything on my dream journal.",1,wp_human

Although it is ideal for citizens to be informed before casting a ballot, there are many ways in which people can educate themselves on political issues before an election.

However, for many languages, there are not enough annotated examples available for training a model from scratch, and research on low-resource languages is often limited to the task of named entity recognition (NER) and POS tagging. With the development of multilingual models, there has been a recent increase in interest in cross-lingual natural language processing. The IWPT 2020 shared tasks on zero-shot and cross-lingual dependency parsing cite{zeman-etal-2020-cross} are dedicated to this task. In the zero-shot setting, systems are provided with the UD treebanks of the 124 languages in UD v2.6, but they are not given any language-specific annotations.

"""May others insult the size of your genitals!"" I could hear her through the open window of the gym locker room. She yelled in a thick Slavic accent, partially concealed by her English-accented words. I didn't know much about my mother's heritage besides that she was of mixed Russian and Polish origin. The rest of our family history had been lost to me. As far as my father knew, he'd been born with blue eyes and blond hair and his entire life consisted of being the man who fathered two sons (not counting the one from when we lived on Long Island). He never spoke ill of the woman who brought us into this world; nor did he ever speak ill of any other women whose sexual activities resulted in pregnancy. Both of those facts made it easier for him to be an active husband and provider while putting up with only sporadic sex. That wasn't easy, given all the golfing trips he took at least once every year to knock back free drinks served in shot glasses marked ""bachelor party."" But there were compensations: he always bought us new clothes, a new car each time he got paid extra or received some sort of award, and even after I turned twenty-one years old, he gave me 10,000 cash so I could stop working part time and start riding around town just like anybody else, doing whatever girls do. The truth is that my real parents divorced soon after they moved to New York City - and then decided to raise their boys together rather than divide their lives between them. When I asked my dad what kind of work he does, he would say things like, ""Oh, you know... investment banking,"" but then add something more vague. We haven't spoken of him since Mom married my stepfather. Even though I have memories of living both separately with the same people, those days are long over now. My mother has never remarried. In fact, not many people call either of us ""parents."" ""Mother"" feels too close to describing someone who birthed us, raised and provided for us, and later abandoned us. My first instinct upon hearing somebody use such terms was always to change the subject or walk away before anything embarrassing might come out. So, often, when people ask questions about where I grew up and how I ended up here, I give cliched answers like ""Mom and Dad split up when I was little,"" which will lead to inquiries about why Mom stayed single, I'll tell them ""she doesn't really want kids right now,"" etc., until eventually I escape the conversation altogether. Few people ever get tired of asking about how I wound up here because most people still assume that everything's cool if you're an orphan. An older aunt told me recently that she believes God wanted me to end up homeless and alone. And yet somehow along the way, I managed to live in three different homes. Perhaps God doesn't make mistakes. I don't think I'm particularly special, except maybe in that none of my birthdays went ignored. Besides, nobody is supposed to die young anyway. It's better to be alive forever. When I was younger, my mom hung posters of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis hanging above the love seat in our apartment whenever I came home late from school. Whenever I inquired about these paintings of string instruments playing a mystical tune, my mom explained that the piece was composed during the German Enlightenment period and represented the transition from medieval church music toward modern classical compositions incorporating themes taken from nature, mythology, and literature. At fourteen, I thought I was pretty smart. A few weeks ago, when a friend mentioned that he heard Beethoven's piano sonata performed by Yo-Yo Ma as a kid, I considered sharing my old mom's explanation, but stopped myself. If the story comes across as strange, well, maybe everyone can connect to something. Not everybody gets to grow up knowing how Mozart wrote his symphonies. Also, you should understand that people aren't always proud of having grown up poor. I've met plenty of rich teenagers. They mostly go places meant to attract wealthy families with lots of money to spend after hours on weekends or vacations. There are private schools. Everything costs a lot. At night, you may stay awake listening to the ocean waves crashing against rocks. By day, perhaps you hang around beaches where people dressed in expensive clothing paddle orange surfboards painted bright colors, while children play under umbrellas next to cliffside cafes serving seafood pastries and teeming with sunburned foreigners drinking beer no less cold than the water below. Some teenagers pretend for awhile that their parents actually care about them, but sooner or later, they find themselves bored with the whole charade. Then they pack their bags and head off to live somewhere else, preferably somewhere warmer. Life isn't perfect, even if it sometimes seems that way. You shouldn't dwell on the bad stuff.

"The Y chromosome contains the SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene. This gene's activation is what triggers a regulation of the embryo's genital formation; inhibiting certain anti-male genes while activating certain pro-male or possibly anti-female genes. Not too much, not too little, otherwise there are problems. All of this happens because like any other chromosome, Y gets 'read' and transcribed at about day 49 of the human's formation, which causes (when all goes well) the differentiation into male or female sex cords. There's a lot of back and forth going across the chromosomes however; in reality it's not as simple as ""have this or that and you'll be a man or a woman,"" and there's a subtle balance required for either - you'll recall women have testosterone as well for example.

"She may not look it, but this 72-year-old is a master con artist. Cathryn Parker has lived under at least 74 aliases in Los Angeles, mainly those of Hollywood production workers. But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for 500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said.

"""May others insult the size of your genitals!"" I could hear her through the open window of the gym locker room. She yelled in a thick Slavic accent, partially concealed by her heavy makeup and black wig: ""I'm going to have fun with you! You'll get it all over again when we go out dancing."" Loud laughter erupted among other girls seemingly unaware that they were being overheard. I heard one say as she pulled off her swimsuit: 'It's so small, even if he touches me there I wouldn't feel anything!' The speaker was next to Christina, who smiled broadly at the compliment and replied: ""What do you think? Small enough for two?"" Her pale blue eyes twinkled mischievously; a hint of humiliation crossed her face before she raised an eyebrow as though daring me to contradict her. As obedient crowd of teenage girls surrounded us on either side, Christina lowered herself back onto my crotch until I felt myself pressed up against her groin once more. As if under orders from some primal instinct, she began grinding her pelvis into mine while playing with my nipples. My cock stiffened painfully between our bodies but only for a moment or two since most of them didn't know what would happen if I got hard right then. Despite their bravado, none had seen any lesbian action like this before and many simply stood there staring dumbfoundedly. A few giggles broke out, mostly coming from the older girls, presumably because they understood how devious it was to tease another girl about something like this without having sex with her. The younger ones seemed genuinely embarrassed yet also got turned on by watching the scene unfold. Only the three cheerleaders - Mandy, Christine, and Kelly - were brave enough to openly laugh at Patty and me, laughing so loud everyone else couldn't help but notice. They knew better than to make eye contact with Christina lest they be mistaken for agreeing with her or worse, making themselves look bad compared to her. I received several dirty looks from Patty's friends which made me wonder whether people noticed what was happening behind the closed doors here. Was everybody thinking about how much of a slut my wife must seem now? How silly I must've been to marry someone who looked like such a whore? If not for the hangovers and broken washing machines, maybe I might've realized sooner that these were questions worth asking. Instead, it took long afterwords for sense to return. Christina continued teasing me mercilessly, knowing full well that I'd never tell anyone about it. After sometime, I became too distracted by those looks to enjoy the situation anymore. Finally, I found my resolve to stand up for her and asked Mandy directly: ""Is it true that she is really big down there?"" Mandy glared at me before replying: ""No...she's average size like every other woman I've ever met."" Then Mandy laughed outright saying it sounded like she already thought I was fucking around on Patty, which led me to believe that perhaps I was getting paranoid. Clearly jealous of Christina's attention towards me, Mandy quickly changed subjects saying: ""But don't worry girlfriend, I am sure you'll still find plenty of guys willing to take you home tonight...""",0,wp_machine_continuation_opt_iml_30b

"Life was much more simple last week. My brother worked his shift in the mines, along with my father and the rest of the town men old enough to handle a pick. My mother was preparing dinner as the mines had let out early to celebrate the holiday. It was Tor-Hanna; the day we were freed from our captors. Before my grandfather's grandfather had been born a war was waged in which the beings of the light defeated those of the miasma. Or so we are all told; none are alive from that time. I had just returned from fishing the small stream that ran south of the town when the ground shook slightly. This wasn't uncommon as the ground tended to ""bump"" to release pressure from the massive mine that had been carved beneath the surface. As I continued home it got worse and there was a massive explosion. Mine collapses happened..... but this was far bigger than the one that killed my grandfather and my uncle. I knew my family would be safe because their shifts would already have ended. A cloud of dark red smoke began to billow into the sky. The thick smell of sulfur overtook me as I gagged and ran towards the mayhem. My house was destroyed. The wall facing the catastrophe was gone, my mother lay under the table unconscious, and my brother was staggering down what was left of the stairwell. He had a large piece of debris sticking out of his thigh and coverall was matted thick with blood. My father had lost his left hand below the elbow. He'd already tied a tight tourniquet around the wound and was trying desperately to dig my mother out. After a few seconds it became apparent that she wasn't alive; her neck had been crushed by debris from the collapsing wall. I had thought wrong. In the days that followed the hole opened up and swallowed more and more of the town. It was obvious that the area was much larger than even the massive mine. It was deep, maybe half a mile or better. On the dawn of the third day the vortex appeared. It was small at first, but then things began to emerge from it. Dark shadows that scaled the steep walls in seconds and began to disperse throughout the town. People went missing in the following hours, and more and more strange things began to appear. A creature the size of a horse with six legs and a caprice as hard as stone killed the town police chief before nightfall. I watched helplessly as he shot it point blank with a powerful shotgun only for it to grab him with it's claws and tear him to pieces. It wandered towards the hole and I hadn't seen it since. That was last week. Today we dropped a large rock down the hole. It landed directly in the vortex and disappeared. We lowered another down with a long rope and were able to pull it back after a few minutes. It seemed no worse for the wear. Tomorrow they plan on sending my brother down to pass through. He volunteered to make the trip and no one dissented. Except for me. His leg is still wounded to the point that he can't walk without a limp. He has at least two or three broken ribs judging by the thick purple and yellow bruises covering his chest, and he's at least temporarily deaf in one ear. So, tonight, I've tying the edge of a two mile long cord from the mine elevator to the sturdiest structure I could find in town. The remainder I looped around a thick oak that was longer than a man is tall. I'm at the bottom and..I'm going to go through. If I don't return. Please don't send help. I made this decision on my own. If I do return. I'll do my best not to bring anything else back with me. May the light help us. - Edward Fanstin - February 29th, 2432",1,wp_human
"Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole. Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother. He shouted ""yes"" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a ""down phase"" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May. In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got ""tanked up"" on alcohol. The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public. Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight. He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events. The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back. But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a ""tragic accident."" The pair will be sentenced on 6 February.",1,xsum_human

After looking reading many reviews on Yelp, I decided to give KODE a try, as their prices are not that steep and the reviews on Yelp were pretty good. I love that they do online booking, it is extremely convenient. I scheduled myself for a half head foil with Kelly Z.

"If you look closely at the patterns on the green board, you'll see the pattern is made up of a bunch of lines packed closely together. Each of these lines is a wire that carries electricity. There are other things on the green board that look like black squares or rectangles. Inside these black boxes are lots and lots (maybe billions) of tiny switches called transistors. Each of these switches can turn on and let electricity flow from one part of the computer chip to another part, or turn off and not let electricity flow. The neat thing about these switches is that they're controlled by electricity. So one switch can turn on and let electricity flow to another switch, and that makes that switch turn on and let electricity flow to yet another switch, and on and on and on. If you connect all these switches correctly, you can make the computer chip do math, and store text, and draw pictures, and play games. The 1s and 0s people talk about in computer chips are just whether a switch is on and electricity is flowing (we call that a 1) or off and electricity is not flowing (we call that a 0). Certain patterns of 1s and 0s represent different numbers or letters. When we use 1s and 0s to represent numbers, it's called [binary numbers] (URL1) and when we use 1s and 0s to represent letters, it's called [unicode] (URL0).,"" ""Electricity is flowing through a bunch of things called transistors: little tiny switches that control the flow of electricity through other transistors.

The researchers say that their method, however, is more like a market in which the seller is allowed to take his or her price down if a rival offers a lower price. ""The prices that we observe are in fact prices of the market for stocks, and we would like to say that this is the real price of stocks,"" Gneiting said.

"France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has declared that some European Union sanctions on Iran could be lifted as early as next month, as part of a deal between the nation and world powers over its nuclear programme. The announcement was made during a press conference in Paris on Tuesday. Mr Fabius explained that the move would come after a potential agreement is reached between Iran and the P51 group of nations - the US, UK, China, France, Russia, and Germany. The news comes after negotiations between the two sides yielded a framework agreement earlier this month. If all goes according to plan, the final deal should be completed by the 30th June. Mr Fabius said: ""There are still quite a few points to be clarified, but we are getting there. If an agreement is reached, it will be possible to lift some of the EU's sanctions as soon as next month."" The EU has imposed a range of economic and financial sanctions on Iran since 2012, in response to the nation's nuclear activities, which have been deemed a threat to international security. If a final agreement is reached, many of these sanctions would be lifted - opening up the way for increased trade between Iran and the EU. This could lead to significant economic benefits for both parties. Mr Fabius added that the deal is likely to include a mechanism for the gradual lifting of sanctions, which is expected to take place over a period of several months. He also stated that any agreement would need to be ratified by the United Nations Security Council before coming into effect. This latest announcement gives further hope that a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis is within reach.",0,xsum_machine_specified_text-davinci-003
"Summary: Genome-to-genome comparisons require designating anchor points, which are given by Maximum Exact Matches (MEMs) between their sequences. For large genomes this is a challenging problem and the performance of these methods is limited due to specialised search algorithms that may not be well suited for non-linear genomic data. To tackle this challenge we propose an approach based on local alignment, greedy searching and domain knowledge combined with simple heuristics in order to identify anchors even from complex DNA sequences such as plasmids. This method was implemented into CreaTect3D v2.51 and evaluated using simulated datasets and rat brain sequence assemblies with different levels of complexity. In addition it has been applied to whole genome shotgun assemblages of bacterial cells and developed further as part of a contribution to one of the projects at the National Bioinformatics Institute, Portugal. Results: Using our algorithm we identified MECs on 14 out of 17 synthetic Plasmodium berghei PCR fragments covering 6 Mbp of sequence length and yielding high quality genome assembly contigs. Compared to other approaches, ECHS and LASER, no significant differences were observed regarding time taken to generate genome annotation. We also compared our results obtained using PbPcR450 math 500 bp size samples to those produced through other RNAi libraries against distinct targets and found that they showed better results than smaller ones. The generation of both short term and long term memory tables used during the alignments allowed us to efficiently process huge amounts of sequence in parallel and generated several thousand MEMs per second throughout all stages of execution. When performing small scale experiments involving scanning individual chromosomes or regions within them, we could produce coverage reports showing hundreds of millions of random matches along each chromosome's entire 5' and 3'. Conclusions: Our work shows how designing anchoring sites can greatly improve performance when assembling large nucleic acid molecules in general but especially so in cases where raw sequence reads do not contain enough information about the genomic context. It will also help reducing uncertainties related to placements calls made possible only by designating some regions as having sufficiently similar patterns. These features make our proposed strategy particularly suitable for use with genome sequencing data coming from very challenging sources such as retroviruses, bacteria, algae, plant viruses etc., obtaining accurate annotations in hours instead of weeks. Finally, since the design strategies involved are generic and easily applicable to any kind of target, there is potential for its implementation in many more applications aimed towards increasing the speed and accuracy of genome sequencing analysis.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_iml_30b
"Of all the holidays that are considered ""National Holidays,"" Christmas is the only one that is premised off of religion. Since in America we believe in the separation of Church State, I do not see how making Christmas a national holiday is justified. I know that other religions have holidays as well around the same time as Christmas and in school kids get the week off for all observances, but in the workplace only Christmas is considered a National Holiday. This year would have been a good representation of what I mean, since Christmas fell on a Wednesday and many only had off for that day (myself included). I did enjoy my time off, but I do not see how we as a society can justify making a National Holiday that is predicated on religion as part of our society. I know that many will say that Christmas isn't even based on religion anymore and that it has just evolved to a corporate money making holiday for retailers. This might be true, but nonetheless we are forced to celebrate a holiday that is based of the birth of a profit for a religion that many in our society do not follow.

Luther was dismayed and tried to distance himself from the revolt, but his writings were used by both sides to further their causes. The war ended in defeat for the peasants and helped to discredit radical elements of the Reformation. Although Luther was unsuccessful in halting the spread of radicalism, his victory at Wittenberg did help to ensure that the Reformation would continue on a more moderate path than it might have had he been defeated.

The beacons would transmit signals that can be picked up by receivers on spacecrafts and rovers, allowing them to calculate their exact location and heading. In addition, the LunarGPS network could also be used for communications. The system would include software that allows for real-time data sharing between spacecrafts and ground control centers, enabling faster response times and better coordination of missions.

"On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, with support from other Arab nations, launched a surprise attack on Israel, on Yom Kippur. This renewal of hostilities in the Arab-Israeli conflict was triggered by Israeli intransigence towards Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace initiative (1972) which had been rejected by Prime Minister Golda Meir. The operation ended two days later after a brief artillery exchange between both sides. It is widely believed that this military campaign was meant to force an early settlement through pressure tactics rather than aiming at territorial gains. Yet it should be remembered that even though neither side involved itself officially in a war for more than ten years following its conclusion, each party continued to pursue their goals toward achieving long term objectives, without conceding any ground or relaxing their positions on key issues, thereby causing significant difficulties in reaching a peaceful solution ever since.[1] One such issue remained unresolved: While the Syrian occupation authorities claimed sovereignty over occupied Golan Heights up until 1967 when they were expelled during the Six Day War,[2] as well as the right to remain in those territories under UN Resolution 242, Israel never recognized these claims nor returned them to Syria. On May 15th 1981, the Security Council adopted resolution 446[3], calling upon all States ""to refrain from taking action which would change the status quo ante regarding territory occupied by armed forces known to belong to another State in accordance with resolutions 242 [of November 22nd 1967, dealing with Jerusalem and including what are now called West Bank land areas]. Any use made by Israel of Golan"" must cease. In 1982, the UN passed a General Assembly resolution declaring Israel's annexation and transfer of population into the Golan null and void; however, no international body has accepted the regime change ordinance resolution' which remains unratified in most countries. Following the defeat in 1967, many Israelis felt abandoned by the international community and began to perceive Israel as being surrounded[4] by hostile states. As time went on, several waves of protests erupted against the foreign policy pursued by then prime minister Levi Eshkol in favor of politicaldiplomatic approaches instead of relying solely on IDF. Nevertheless, not only did he fail to reverse the trend, but also his successors expanded it further.[5] It became obvious that diplomacy could not resolve the crisis unless the parties agreed to speak to one another directly - and persuading them to do so proved difficult. Meanwhile, Cairo kept demanding full normalization of relations while refusing to recognize the existence of Israel. When Khrushchev visited Jordan in 1960 and was received enthusiastically, King Hussein asked him about UN recognition of statehood in Palestine. Immediately after leaving office, Khrushchev replied that the Soviet Union reserved the right not to give its endorsement to the partition plan proposed by United Nations Special Commission.[6] He argued that it would have failed because Jews and Arabs alike opposed Partition Plan; rather, he favored finding a peaceful way out which required reaching agreement among Palestinians and Jewish leaders in order to end the prolonged violence and block expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who lived outside camps.[7] To Khruschev's dismay, Saudi Arabia refused UN membership if Ethiopia's request for admission was approved. Following his meeting with Hussein in February 1961, he informed Moscow that he left behind instructions for ""the creation of independent capital"" in East Jerusalem.[8] A month earlier, Ben Gurion's government authorized construction work in the city leading to condemnation by the Soviets.[9] In 1965, despite assurances given by both governments to Washington, subsequent US administrations decided to abstain from voting on whether to admit Lebanon into the UN. Meanwhile, Vietnam presented an alternative model for resolving problems within the region in terms of autonomy for smaller groups, thus challenging certain aspects of Zionism. Moreover, some members of the old guard expressed criticism of the Labor Zionist movement and its willingness to negotiate away territorial concessions demanded by higher ranking officials in return for favorable votes on economic measures favoring Israel.[10] All of this, added to the knowledge that America was spending billions on arms delivery programs in Europe, led to increasing disenchantment with Israel's geopolitical situation. Consequently, whereas before 1948, there was great enthusiasm for staying put in Judea Samaria (West Bank), afterward few people supported the projection of Tel Aviv into the Negev. At least twenty percent did agree with the latter option,[11] yet any moves in this direction faced resistance from ultra orthodox religious circles. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, pressure increased amongst neighbouring Arab powers to topple the Husseinis' rule in Iraq. Simultaneously, Iran developed closer ties to Turkey and participated in joint ventures with Turkish firms opening factories in Tehran.[12] Furthermore on August 19th 1963, Baghdad hosted a conference attended by representatives of the Arab League where supporters of Nasser's line criticized King Faisal II, accusing him of treason.[13] Four months later, the Iraqi parliament passed a law prohibiting Jewish organizations working inside the country!

Home phones - for consumers, are useless (businesses have a reason to need phones that go over copper lines, their conversations have value beyond entertainment and VoIP can really kill the mood but it's getting better all the time). There's no reason for me to have a home phone now or anytime in my future. I'm rarely ever home to use it just to start! I work 8 hours a day, I sleep 8 hours a day, I don't always go straight home and I don't always make it home in time for my bedtime. Most consumers would be better off using email or setting up their own free phone via the internet instead of going with some established provider like Vonage or less established Magic Jack if a home phone was really a desire. If you have the internet, you already have phone service, the idea that you'd buy phone service on top of the internet you already have is one of the most wasteful decisions a consumer could make. Skype much? If you're using a cell phone, it makes this purchase all that much more counter productive to the future and all that much more living in a world that doesn't actually exist anymore. Cable TV - Even if you don't watch but 1 or 2 channels your bill gets divided up to companies based on the overall viewers of everyone on their exclusive network that few people have enough money to enter. You're essentially paying for the right to an exclusive network that gets your money even if you take no actions that refuses to let small fish play in their games. How does that make any sense for you to pay money to people who had nothing to do with the content you enjoy the most? This is why content we like gets killed (Firefly) and content we hate gets dozens of seasons (any sitcom with a laugh track, save no show because if you're stupid enough to add laugh tracks your TV show isn't worth watching) without much hesitation. If we had a system of distribution primarily through the internet (there are too many to list) we could more accurately give money to the content creators we like and not give any money to the content creators we dislike. I get the idea that as a consumer I don't have a fiduciary ""right"" to content based on how content owners want to give access to it away but that's their problem not consumers (if pirates can do it better than the content owners need better motivations to sell their product). I find that people who rail against XYZ (fox) channel while watching XXYZ (msnbc) on the same exclusive network are accomplishing nothing on top of the nothing their complaints would already be. If they would have used the internet (and there's a host of journalistic and entertainment options for politics and everything else) they could have better supported the content they want without paying the content creators they claim to hate. On a small side note to cable TV, much like with music there's more content being created than one could physically possible watchlisten to. This isn't to excuse negative actions like piracy but the value placed on these services is way too high and consumers are really paying a premium for content they'll never even know existed let alone watch. Already a whole third of the show is given to advertisements that you pay for each month (you pay your cable company to show you boner pill ads, seriously). I don't think consumers should be expected to be double billed when it wouldn't be possible to watch ""everything"" even if you only limit everything to the things that interest you. The internet solves these problems, and the people who still find value in cable I find are not living in the current state of technology and are wasting their time, money, and aren't living in today's world experience the world of today.

I think most people accept that it is a result of multiple factors including:invasion from other people, internal revolt (they were sacrificing people left right and center, I'd revolt), the loss of trade routes, diseases and a large drought. It also happened relatively quickly, which is another factor in the confusion.

"This has to be one of the most awfully scripted films I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.The movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (I think that the movie was originally dubbed in Italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for US release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.Poor Ray Milland...he's certainly come a long way down from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in.

"'So, please welcome my next guest, Dr. Andrew Reynolds!' The applause from the audience thundered as a thin man walked out into the studio. He wore glasses and had a well-tailored suit. His hair was gelled up into spikes. He looked to be in his mid-twenties, which made his achievement all the more special. For Reynolds had done something amazing. He had cured AIDS. It had made the news for the entire week since the announcement. Several companies were already mass-producing the cure and thousands of victims were already being treated. There were no side-effects, it was cheap and easy to make, and protected a person for life. Of course, Reynolds became a global celebrity overnight. He was constantly being asked to appear on news programmes, interviews, radio shows, magazines, newspapers, you name it. Everyone wanted to talk to the man who had defeated one of the most stubborn conditions known to man. But he hadn't accepted any of their offers. Until tonight. The host of this particular talk show was Richard Carlton, one of America's best-loved hosts. His good humour, insightful comments and interesting questions made for excellent entertainment. Everyone had been looking forward to tonight's show. 'Hello, Andy - is it alright if I call you Andy? Please, do sit down.' 'Thank you, Richard,' said Reynolds politely, easing himself down onto the couch.'It's great to be here. Really great.' 'It's great to have you here, Andy,' replied Richard, smiling.'So, I'm going to cut straight to the chase. How did you cure the seemingly incurable disease that is AIDS?' 'Well,' began Reynolds, sitting back.'It all began about two years ago. I was doing research into aggressive viruses and how they could possibly be harnessed to fight proper diseases. Basically, my idea was to fight fire with fire.' He smiled.'Of course, it wasn't simply a case of creating the opposite to AIDS. I had to make sure that the two would cancel each other out, not rip apart the person in the process. The artificial viruses I created were made to recognise the human body and work around it whilst fighting the AIDS virus. Otherwise it would be more a case of slash-and-burn.' 'So did that work? How did you test it?' said Richard, leaning forwards. 'It was difficult at first,' said Reynolds, adjusting his glasses.'The main problem was that the anti-AIDS viruses couldn't be tested in anything other than a human, since they were only able to recognise human DNA. Even chimpanzees didn't work. They just died soon after the injection. No, it had to be a human subject.' Richard blinked a few times before collecting himself.'You mean, you had a volunteer to be injected with AIDS?' 'No, no, of course not!' laughed Reynolds.'I knew that such trials were made illegal, but we have to make sacrifices in the name of progress, don't we?' 'Then who did you test the cure on?' said Richard. His brow was beginning to shine with sweat under the studio lights. 'An assistant of mine,' replied Reynolds.'Her name is Cassandra Phillips, or Cassie, as she likes to be called. I brought her into the lab one day, sedated her, and administered the first test cure along with the AIDs sample.' Richard swallowed and glanced at the cameras. He smiled nervously.'So where is she now? How did she react?' Reynolds crossed his legs and shook his head with a small smile.'Obviously I couldn't let her go before the tests were done. What if the sample didn't work and she had transferred the disease? No, I kept her in a specially constructed observation room. It allowed me to study the effects more easily.' Richard glanced down at his notes, feeling sick. This man was obviously quite mad.'You do realise that's unethical, don't you?' 'Unethical!' exclaimed Reynolds.'Ethics must be thrown aside if we are to defeat these diseases! Take autonomy, for example. A patient has the right to accept or refuse their treatment. And look where that has gotten us. Parents refusing to give their children vaccines because they think it'll cause autism, allowing things like measles to spread across the States! It's madness. If we made sure every last person was vaccinated against measles, it would be gone once and for all!' He lowered his voice a little.'So that's why I had to do it, you see. By ignoring medical ethics one time, I have cured AIDS. Think how easy it will be to take on something like cancer if we ignore things like that. Autonomy - out the window. Doing a patient no harm is one I would rather not break, but if it requires sacrificing the one to help the many, I would do so in a heartbeat!' 'But Ms. Phillips,' protested Richard.'Where is she now?' 'Still in my lab,' drawled Reynolds.'Once the AIDS virus worked, I thought I might as well keep her for other tests. No sense in wasting a good testing ground, is there?' 'I'm sorry, but you don't seem to understand ethical medical practices at all,' said Richard.'Even if you have cured AIDS, you have violated a person's rights as a patient and your responsibilities as a medical practitioner.' He looked to one of the crew.'Get the police in here now! And someone find Ms. Phillips immediately!' 'Scared of the truth, Carlton?' sneered Reynolds.'Let me ask you something. If you knew you could cure all worldly diseases by making one person suffer for a few years, would you do it? I did, and look at the result. We now have a cure for AIDS, and soon I shall make the same breakthrough with cancer as well. And all it will take is the sacrifice of a tiny portion of the rules we have put in place around ourselves.' He stood up and turned to the cameras, arms raised. 'It is only by breaking the rules that we can break the deadlock!' he proclaimed, eyes bulging.'I am a man of medicine, and I was taught that it was wrong to break the moral code! But see what happened when I did! And I will not rest until every last disease in the world is defeated! Even if it means the suffering of a few people, I am working for the greater good!' At that moment, six burly police officers barged into the studio and grabbed Reynolds by the arms. He was dragged bodily from in front of the cameras. They turned to see him being pulled through the main doors. As he disappeared from view, everyone could hear him shouting. 'I regret nothing!' he yelled.'You should all thank me for what I did! For the greater goo The closing doors cut off his last word. Richard cleared his throat as the cameras turned back to him. He smiled hesitantly. 'Go to commercials?'",1,wp_human
"Well, first off, a lot of them do succeed in the NFL. It's just more interesting when a really good college player turns out to be a bust, so people tend to focus more on those cases. That being said, there are a few key factors that play into whether or not a college player will be successful in the NFL. First, it's important for them to have the physical ability and size to compete at the professional level. Secondly, their mental makeup and ability to handle the pressure of playing at the highest level is critical. Finally, they must be able to adjust to an entirely different level of competition than what they were used to in college.

"I know this isn't such a big topic to discuss but it's been on my mind for some time. Men are always going on about how women are really hard to understand and that there isn't really any point in trying to understand women. I don't understand this, really I don't. I do understand that women generally have some qualities that render them as confusing but yet, in my opinion, men and women both have similar ways of acting in a relationship. For example, they both get jealous sometimes, they both nag at eachother. If women are confusing, then so are men. Sometimes I just feel like men saying that 'they can't understand women' is just an excuse to be lazy in a relationship by not trying to see from a woman's point of view and because they don't want to have to make the effort to do the stuff that women like. Maybe, I'm being hypocritical, as woman could be just as 'ignorant' as this 'women are hard to understand' stereotype. Don't get me wrong, I understand that not all men are like this, and there are probably alot of men who do make the effort, but I still believe that there is a common but wrong stereotype that women are really hard to understand.

"Dr. Silverstone clicked his pen absentmindedly, trying to remember the name of his next client. It started with a M, or an H, but he couldn't quite remember which. Leaning forward, he pressed a button on his desk, and the intercom crackled to life. ""Who's appointment is next?"" A young, bouncy female voice answered, sounding ecstatic just being alive. ""The two o'clock is Mr. Shackleton, Doctor!"" With a grunt, he leaned back again, releasing the intercom button, and scribbled down the name. Apparently it wasn't an M or an H. Filling out the rest of the form, he paused at the last section. Reason for therapy: Glancing up at the clock, Dr. Silverstone saw that it read 2:03. Shackleton was late. Leaving the last spot blank, he placed the pen and clipboard down, and was just about to reach for the intercom again when it turned on by itself. He could practically feel the smile through the intercom when she said, ""The two o'clock has arrived, Doctor!"" Frowning, he glared at the speaker that lay on his desk. She must be new. No one smiled for long when they worked next to him. He was about to stand up, when the door opened, and a small, rather disheveled man peered in. ""Is this the right place?"" Dr. Silverstone raised his eyebrows. ""There's only one office in this building, so unless you wanted to find an empty room to cry in, this is where you need to be."" He gestured to the red couch that lay in front of his desk, and rolled his own chair around, scooping up the clipboard as he went. Hesitantly, the man sat down on the edge of the couch, and folded his hands in front of him. For a brief moment, he was still, but then he started nervously tapping his shoe. Dr. Silverstone watched this with a skeptical eye, until the man noticed, and forced himself to stop ""Lie down, make yourself comfortable."" While the sentence was amiable enough, the doctors tone made it sound more like a threat. A grumpy threat. Glancing down at his clipboard, he took off his glasses. ""You are..... Mr Shackleton, right?"" The man had started wringing his hands, but he lay down obediently. ""Nackleton, actually. Timothy Nackleton."" ""Hmph."" Silverstone scribbled a note down. He probably hadn't felt like correcting the intern when she got his name wrong. ""Well, I suppose we had better get to work, then."" Glancing over at the figity man, he frowned. ""Put your arms at your sides and hold still, for Pete's sake."" Puzzled, Nackleton slowly obeyed. ""Um, excuse me, but..... are you really a therapist, sir?"" ""What makes you say that, Nackle?"" growled Dr Silverstone. He fumbled around on his desk for a moment, looking for something. The man frowned. ""I thought therapists were supposed to be..... I dunno, nice and cheerful, or something."" Finally finding the thing he was looking for, a black remote, he rolled his chair back to the couch, and checked Nackleton over, tucking in any bits that stuck out too far. ""Never liked those half-witted excuses for therapists, always dancing around the issue with their talking and their sympathizing. It's much simpler just to get to the root of the problem."" With that, he pressed a big red button on the remote. Immediately, large metal bands slid out from under the couch and wrapped themselves around Mr. Nackleton, securing his so tightly they knocked the air out of him. A feeble scream escaped his lips. Guiding his chair back around behind the desk, Dr. Silverstone punched in a couple more buttons on the remote. Bright lights flared from each corner, and a panel opened in the wall, revealing an array of glowing weapons, from a tiny, shining dagger, to a massive broadsword. Picking up a pair of curved blades, he swung them around experimentally. ""Wha..... What's going on?"" Nackleton was frantic, struggling against his bonds. ""Who are you? What are you going to do to me?"" He paused, gasping from the exertion. ""I'm your therapist, Mr Nackleton. This is going to be your first, and hopefully only session."" Discarding the dual swords, he picked up an axe, the head glowing with an unearthly light. He tested the edge on his finger, and it passed right through, leaving an ice cold wake behind it. Hefting it over his shoulder, he turned back toward the couch, and pressed one more button on the remote. ""Lets get started."" Immediately, the couch started to glow, and Nackleton screamed again, holding it out for several seconds before running out of breath. Gasping, he screamed again, but this time it was deeper, strange coming from a man so small. This time it didn't stop, instead just getting louder and louder, until it shook the walls. A dark blob appeared on Nackleton's chest, and quickly grew. Looking carefully, Dr. Silverstone decided the slight tinge of blue probably meant it was anxiety, which made sense, considering how nervous the man seemed. It got bigger and bigger, leaving Nackleton's chest and stretching up to the ceiling. It was enormous, bigger than anything Silverstone had seen before, and he had to suppress a twitch. Anxiety fed off of fear, so it was better to give it as little as possible. Finally, it stopped ballooning. At the top, a gaping mouth appeared, stretching wide. The wailing continued, but by now it was clearly inhuman, a screech beyond the reach of human vocal chords. Rather suddenly, the screaming stopped, and the blob slithered off of the glowing couch to the ground. Above the dripping maw, two sideways slits opened, each with a mass of tiny blue dots. The swirling eyes gazed down at Silverstone. Not wasting a moment, the doctor swung his axe, aiming to slice it clean in two. It hissed, and slid away from the blow. It stretched out, getting thinner and longer, until it resembled an enormous, oozy snake. Curling up, it watched Silverstone carefully. Lifting his axe defensively, he stalked closer to the beast, watching for any movement. With every step forward, it curled tighter and tighter, looking ready to strike. But he was ready for it. He feigned forward, and the anxiety struck, mouth gaping wide. Dodging to the side, he swung the axe in a small arc, and the glowing blade sliced right through the neck of the snake as it flew by. The two separate pieces fell to the ground with a heavy thud. The cut edges started dissolving, and he kicked them into a corner to finish disappearing. With a sigh, Silverstone sat back down, placing the axe casually on his desk. Scooping up the clipboard and pen, he scribbled down a summary of the session. Halfway through, a huffing got his attention. Nackleton was still bound to the couch, and he was watching the snake dissolve with wide eyes. ""What was that?"" Glancing briefly at the doctor, his eyes focused on the glowing axe. ""Did you just..... kill it?"" ""That was your Anxiety, Nackle. It's gone, for now. You get to experience a bit of freedom from it."" Peering over the clipboard, he looked Nackleton in the eyes. ""But you can't be lazy about it. If you let it, it'll simply grow back."" Nackleton wouldn't look at him, instead gazing over Silverstone's shoulder, avoiding eye contact. ""Why'd you kill the snake, but not that one?"" There was a moment of silence. And then Silverstone spun around, twisting the cap on his pen as he went. A glittering blade burst from the tip of the pen, and he swung out behind him. But he was too late. Something small and fast hit his face, knocking him from the chair. They hit the ground, and Silverstone dropped the pen, instead grabbing frantically at the tiny demon that snarled and scribbled at his eyes. It was strong, and at the ends of its hands and feet were sharp claws. When he finally got a grip on it, he peeled it from his face, and held it up. From the glimpses he got, he saw no color, aside from its eye, which was a single ball of dark red hate. It was a suicidal thought, the most dangerous of all. It scratched at his wrists, trying to get closer to him, and it was all he could do to hold it in place. Rolling over, he pinned it against the floor with his whole body weight, and reached out for his pen with his free hand. Snatching up the blade, he lifted up and stabbed at the ground beneath him. There was nothing there, and the blade stabbed into the floor, stopping at the pen hilt. It hit with such force that the pen snapped, and the blade fizzled away. Abandoning useless pen, he whirled around, just in time to see the little dark demon launch itself toward him again, and he raised his arms to cover his face. Between his arms, he saw a flash of light, and a horrible gurgling noise. When nothing happened, he peeked out. The demon lay on the floor, cut clean in half, and a young woman wearing a sweater and jeans stood before it. She was holding one of the swords from the rack, and she lowered it. She wiped her brow and grinned at the doctor. ""Whew! Good thing I came in when I did, huh?"" He recognized her voice from the intercom, and gazed at her disbelievingly. ""You're the new intern?"" She smiled even wider, teeth shining almost as much as the sword. ""Yep! Heard some weeeird noises in here, so I decided to see if you needed any help. Saw the little monster and a bunch of glowing weapons, so I did what seemed the most prudent. I stabbed the little bugger with the first thing I could get my hands on!"" She stuck her hand out to help him up. ""This was certainly an interesting first day on the job!"" Taking her hand and standing up, he gave her a once over. She was spattered in dark flecks, held a glowing sword, and had possibly just saved his life. Despite himself, Dr. Silverstone grinned back at her. Maybe this one was a keeper. From the couch, Nacklton cleared his throat. ""So..... do I pay at the front?""",1,wp_human
"The period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century ""the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it."" But most buildings were still designed by builders and landlords together, and the wide spread of Georgian architecture, and the Georgian styles of design more generally, came from dissemination through pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings. This contrasted with earlier styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct experience of the apprenticeship system. Authors such as the prolific William Halfpenny (active ) received editions in America as well as Britain. From the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an architectural vernacular that became part and parcel of the training of every architect, designer, builder, carpenter, mason and plasterer, from Edinburgh to Maryland.",1,squad_human

"Let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie. Despite having a seemingly promising premise and a talented cast, ""Disappointment: The Film"" ultimately fails to deliver on all fronts. The plot meanders all over the place, getting increasingly convoluted with each passing scene. It's practically impossible to pinpoint what the film's true purpose is or what message it's trying to send to the audience. The writing is perhaps the weakest link in this chain of mediocrity. Characters are one-dimensional and have barely any development throughout the film, leaving the talented actors to grapple with dialogue that seems to have been pulled together from a series of cliches and tired tropes. Speaking of the actors, their performances are shockingly subpar - which can only be attributed to poor directing, given their prowess in the industry. Visually, the movie doesn't fare much better. The cinematography is jarring and inconsistent, often pulling focus away from the action on screen. The editing leaves much to be desired, with scenes cut together haphazardly, and often ruining any sense of pacing or flow. It's evident that there was once a spark of potential within ""Disappointment: The Film,"" but whatever that spark may have been, it quickly fizzles out under the weight of its own inadequacies. Save yourself the time and frustration, and skip this one.",0,imdb_gpt4
"The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the steam's ability to both do work (heat) and to convert heat into work (work). The Rankine cycle is named after the Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine . In the late 1850s Rankine developed a theory of heat that was important in the development of thermodynamics. The Rankine cycle is important in the power industry because of its thermodynamic efficiency, that is, its ability to do mechanical work. Steam engines are used to drive turbines that generate electricity. The mechanical energy of a steam engine is coupled to the shaft of a turbine by a metal connecting rod. The heat of the steam can be used to evaporate water at the same time, and the resulting steam expands and does mechanical work as it rises through the turbine. The temperature of the steam within the turbine must be kept constant, so that the steam performs its work without wasting energy. This is accomplished by circulating the steam in a continuous loop that is known as the Rankine cycle. The Rankine cycle is not just a closed system, but it is a type of heat engine that relies on the Carnot cycle to extract work from heat. That is, the Rankine cycle is an expansion engine in which the power is extracted from the difference in temperature between the hot and cold end of the cycle. The Rankine cycle is a form of heat engine that uses steam to drive a turbine, with the hot and cold cycles of the engine combined to provide a net power output. There are four primary components in the Rankine cycle: a boiler, a turbine, a condenser, and an expansion valve. The boiler heats the water in a heat exchanger so that it can be converted to steam. The turbine converts the expansion of the steam into rotational mechanical energy. The condenser cools the steam in order to condense it back into water. The steam is then piped back to the boiler through the expansion valve, which increases the steam's pressure. The Rankine cycle was first proposed in 1856 by the Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine , who was working at the University of Glasgow. He was the first to clearly describe a cycle of energy conversion for a heat engine, and proposed a design for a steam engine based upon this cycle. The Rankine cycle was originally conceived as a continuous-flow heat engine. In the Rankine cycle, the engine is designed to take advantage of the heat energy and isothermal expansion of steam. In the 1860s, Rudolf Clausius , a German physicist and mathematician, devised a theoretical model of the Carnot cycle that used a series of perfect gas expansions and adiabatic processes to convert heat into work. The Rankine cycle was a major contribution to the development of thermodynamics, because it introduced the concept of the continuous-flow heat engine. This model is still used today to design and build steam engines, steam turbines, and steam generators. The Rankine cycle was first used in a working engine by Henry D. Rogers , an American inventor and engineer. Rogers patented the engine in 1869, but his design was never used in commercial power plants. The Rankine cycle was first applied in an operating power plant in 1888, at a power plant at the University of Michigan. The Rankine cycle was also developed by Frank J. Sprague , who is often called the ""Father of the Electric Railway"" for developing a system of electrical power for railroad companies. Sprague's engine used a coal-fired boiler to heat water to produce steam, which was then used to power a turbine. The steam was then condensed and returned to the boiler through a tubular heat exchanger. The Rankine cycle is a common type of heat engine in which the power is extracted from a heat source, often in the form of steam. A Rankine cycle is most commonly used to generate electricity from coal, oil, or natural gas. The Rankine cycle is not limited to fossil fuels, and is also used to generate steam from nuclear or geothermal energy, and to generate steam for use in spacecraft propulsion systems. The Rankine cycle is a type of heat engine in which",0,squad_machine_continuation_7B

"He sat across the street from her house, making sure he had all the necessary supplies for the night. Susan Burbank, late twenties, red hair, just like the 23 others he had that year. It was an easy and safe job. He didn't need to kill them. He just needed to render them unconscious, take what he needed from them, and then leave. He had just finished staking the last of his supplies to the ground when he heard her walk outside. She was going to go around to the front and take the garage, but he had taken care of that. He had staked that part of the garage to the ground, and her car was sitting in the middle of it. The garage door lifted, and a faint light shone from the kitchen. She was inside, and she was going to sleep, unaware that her life was about to change. He had to get it right. He had to make it look like an accident, and he had to make it look like a robbery. He stood up and walked towards the house. The front door opened and she stepped out, a breeze from the open door blowing her long red hair back from her face. She was wearing a black tank top and black shorts, and her legs were long and slender. He walked up behind her and put his arm around her. She turned around, startled. ""Oh, hi,"" she said. ""I was hoping we could go for a walk,"" he said. ""I think we need to talk."" ""Yes,"" she said. ""I think we do."" ""Let's go for a walk,"" he said again. ""Ok,"" she said, looking around her yard. ""Do you want to use the front door or the garage?"" ""The front door,"" he said. ""I think we need to go inside."" ""Ok,"" she said, and she walked around the side of the house. He followed her into the house and through the living room into the kitchen. ""What's going on?"" she asked. ""Why don't you sit down,"" he said. ""Ok,"" she said, and she sat down at the kitchen table. ""I'm really glad I ran into you tonight,"" he said. ""I'm glad too,"" she said. ""I've been thinking about you a lot lately. It's been so nice getting to know you."" ""It's been nice getting to know you too,"" he said. ""I was thinking about us,"" he said. ""I was thinking about us too,"" she said. ""You know, it seems like we're getting closer and closer."" ""We are,"" he said. ""I was thinking about our relationship. What if we decided to take it to the next level?"" ""Would you like to take it to the next level?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" she said. ""I would like that."" ""Are you ready to take it to the next level?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" she said. ""I've been wanting to do that for a long time."" ""I've been wanting to do that for a long time too,"" he said. ""Let's go upstairs and take it to the next level."" She stood up and smiled. ""Ok,"" she said. ""I'll go get my coat."" ""I'll go get my coat,"" he said, and he walked down to the garage. He was surprised to find a ladder there, and he climbed up into the loft. She was going to be pleased. She was going to think he was so romantic. She came back downstairs. He was waiting for her at the bottom. ""I'll go get my shoes,"" he said. She walked upstairs.

"Tensor completion is a challenging problem with various applications. Many related models based on the low-rank prior of the tensor have been proposed. However, the low-rank prior may not be appropriate for all types of tensors. To deal with this issue, several tensor completion models based on sparse priors have been proposed. Although these sparse priors provide better flexibility, the computational cost of these models is very high due to the mixed effect of the sparse and low-rank priors. In this work, we propose a novel model for multi-image super-resolution (SR) based on a tensor-sparse prior. The proposed model contains only the sparse prior, which is more appropriate for multi-image SR. We further develop a block coordinate descent-based algorithm to solve this model. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_65B

Black and white, but hey, this guy had probably never seen a photograph, and I didn't have long on google to download all this stuff. It showed a battleship, clearly huge compared to the tiny people.

"Hashing aims at generating highly compact similarity preserving code words which are well suited for large-scale image retrieval tasks. Most existing hashing methods first encode the images as a vector of hand-crafted features followed by a separate binarization step to generate hash codes. This two-stage process may produce sub-optimal encoding. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing through residual learning, termed Deep Residual Hashing (DRH), for an end-to-end simultaneous representation learning and hash coding. The DRH model constitutes four key elements: (1) a sub-network with multiple stacked residual blocks; (2) hashing layer for binarization; (3) supervised retrieval loss function based on neighbourhood component analysis for similarity preserving embedding; and (4) hashing related losses and regularisation to control the quantization error and improve the quality of hash coding. We present results of extensive experiments on a large public chest x-ray image database with co-morbidities and discuss the outcome showing substantial improvements over the latest state-of-the art methods.",1,sci_gen_human

"The multi-valued logic of ukasiewicz is a substructural logic that has been widely studied and has many interesting properties. It is classical, in the sense that it admits the axiom schema of double negation elimination, [ DNE ] . However, our understanding of ukasiewicz logic can be improved by separating its classical and intuitionistic aspects. The intuitionistic aspect of ukasiewicz logic is captured in an axiom schema, [ CWC ] , which asserts the commutativity of a weak form of conjunction. We explain how this axiom is equivalent to a restricted form of contraction. We then show how ukasiewicz Logic can be viewed both as an extension of classical affine logic with [ CWC ] , or as an extension of what we call intuitionistic ukasiewicz logic with [ DNE ] , intuitionistic ukasiewicz logic being the extension of intuitionistic affine logic by the schema [ CWC ] . At first glance, intuitionistic ukasiewicz logic seems to be a very weak fragment of intuitionistic logic. We show that [ CWC ] is a surprisingly powerful (restricted) form of contraction, implying for instance all the intuitionistically valid De Morgan's laws. However the proofs can be very intricate. These results are presented using derived connectives to clarify and motivate the proofs. Applications include: a simpler proof of the Ferreirim-Veroff-Spinks theorem, proof that idempotent elements of a hoop form a sub-hoop, proof that double negation is a hoop homomorphism, and proofs for the above mentioned De Morgan dualities. We conclude by showing that our homomorphism result on the double-negation mapping in particular implies that all negative translations of classical into intuitionistic ukasiewicz coincide (as they do in full intuitionistic logic). This is in contrast with affine logic for which we show, by appeal to results on semantics proved in a companion paper, that both the Gentzen and the Glivenko translations fail.",1,sci_gen_human

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly critical in modern safety-critical systems, for example in their perception layer to analyze images. Unfortunately, there is a lack of methods to ensure the functional safety of DNN-based components. The machine learning literature suggests one should trust DNNs demonstrating high accuracy on test sets. In case of low accuracy, DNNs should be retrained using additional inputs similar to the error-inducing ones. We observe two major challenges with existing practices for safety-critical systems: (1) scenarios that are underrepresented in the test set may represent serious risks, which may lead to safety violations, and may not be noticed; (2) debugging DNNs is poorly supported when error causes are difficult to visually detect. To address these problems, we propose HUDD, an approach that automatically supports the identification of root causes for DNN errors. We automatically group error-inducing images whose results are due to common subsets of selected DNN neurons. HUDD identifies root causes by applying a clustering algorithm to matrices (i.e., heatmaps) capturing the relevance of every DNN neuron on the DNN outcome. Also, HUDD retrains DNNs with images that are automatically selected based on their relatedness to the identified image clusters. We have evaluated HUDD with DNNs from the automotive domain. The approach was able to automatically identify all the distinct root causes of DNN errors, thus supporting safety analysis. Also, our retraining approach has shown to be more effective at improving DNN accuracy than existing approaches.",1,sci_gen_human

"Astonishing images have depicted a city located in the northwestern region of China being devoured by the fierce red sandstorms that are currently spreading across the area. The cities in China that are affected by pollution have been hit with a new problem as they have experienced the fourth huge sandstorm in the north-west region of the country this year. According to The People's Daily Online, pictures depict Golmud city in the northwestern Qinghai Province succumbing to a severe sandstorm that lasted for half an hour, causing visibility to drop to as low as 30 meters. The city of Golmud in northwest China, home to a population of 200,000, is hit by a fierce sand storm. This year, there have been four sandstorms in the area which have caused difficulties for authorities in managing the natural dangers. The north of China was hit by sandstorms, prompting the Meteorological Centre to release a blue alert. The National Meteorological Centre of China has recently released a notification for the current sandstorms impacting the northern areas, stating a blue alert. In the northern part of the country, a fourth sandstorm hit the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, and Shaanxi, causing strong winds and floating sand as the red sand moved across the area. After the sandstorms, the organisation recommended that residents remain inside and that local governments prepare for the clean-up process. The Chinese weather warning system consists of four levels that are color-coded, in which red implies the highest severity, followed by orange, yellow, and blue. The pictures of Dunhuang, a city in the north-western province of Gansu, depict a dense orange fog covering the city's air and the emptiness of the streets giving the place a surreal and extraterrestrial-like aspect. Downtown areas experienced visibility of under 50 meters, according to a meteorologist who was local. According to Hui Chuang, a speaker representing the police, the storm made it challenging for individuals to drive due to the poor visibility and breathe without inhaling sand, resulting in most people staying indoors. The closure of Mogao Grottoes nearby was also compelled by it. The location is a tourist attraction that has been recognized by UNESCO as a world heritage site, known specifically for its extensive cave carvings and frescoes on a cliff. Yesterday, when the sand cloud swept over the city, Golmud was left enveloped in a striking reddish haze. The storm caused traffic to come to a halt and prompted residents to seek shelter. Two officials from the local government are making an effort to remove sand from the pavements of the city. To navigate through the swirling sand cloud, vehicles turned on their headlights. Yesterday's fierce sandstorm did not stop a police cruiser from driving through the traffic. In order to alert residents beforehand, the weather warning system assigned the sandstorm the color blue as part of its coded system.

"We study the problem of recognizing visual entities from the textual descriptions of their classes. Specifically, given birds' images with free-text descriptions of their species, we learn to classify images into one of the classes. Since the descriptions can vary significantly in length and content, we propose a model to learn representations of visual entities by extracting relevant information from the text without relying on any hand-crafted features. Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder maps the textual description into a latent embedding space. The decoder takes both the embedding and the image as input and predicts the class label. We evaluate our proposed method on the challenging Birdsnap dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results. Our method follows an encoder-decoder architecture, which consists of two main modules: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder module is responsible for mapping the given textual description into a latent embedding space. This is done by leveraging a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT) to extract meaningful information from the text. The decoder takes both the embedding and the image as input and predicts the class label. To train our model, we use a cross-entropy loss with regularization terms to ensure the smoothness of the latent embedding space and its consistency with the original text. We evaluate our method on the challenging Birdsnap dataset, a collection of images of birds with free-text descriptions of their species. We compare our results with several baseline methods and show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on this task. In particular, our method outperforms the baselines by a significant margin, with an accuracy of 86.9.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_text-davinci-003

"[substeps] Teasing is the method of creating texture where you use a teasing brush or flat oval brush to comb small sections of your hair backward. Start in the center section and work out evenly from there. ""The texture on its own isn't as important, but it's nice because it really helps set off one color versus another,"" says Rene Furterer, hairstylist for Jennifer Connelly. ""Not every girl wants that same strong look all over."" A few good places to try: In front of the ears; behind the neckline at nape; through the back. Texture can be created with varying degrees of strength by using teasing products (available at salons) that contain either waxes or pomades. The stronger, more textured effect gives the illusion of volume in thinning areas without actually adding any. For example, if you're growing hair and want an overall less feminine appearance, texturizing will help give you the desired shape and control. If you already have the length and thickness you desire, then don't bother - it won't make much difference anyway. Tease before blow-drying well after shampooing so dampness doesn't interfere with adhesion. """,0,hswag_machine_continuation_opt_iml_30b

"This is going to be a wall of text because I want to be very clear about what I am proposing. I believe that reproduction is a human right. I believe that the current social safety net infringes on this right for many working and middle class people. I believe that the current system also perpetuates a cycle of dependency by rewarding irresponsible behavior. Here's an example to illustrate my point: My sister has two children, because that is what she and her husband can afford. My mother is a probation officer. The majority of her clients are on public assistance and have at least 3 and often many more kids. The particular program my mom oversees is for probationers who refuse to get or keep a job. Opportunity is not the issue here as this area has a strong economy and a job placement program offered by the county has no trouble finding jobs for people with criminal records. As I see it, responsible people like my sister are essentially subsidizing the life choices of less responsible people like my mom's clients. My sister would have more money and thus the opportunity to have more children if she didn't have to pay to feed, cloth and educate the children of people who refuse to work. With current public assistance programs, there is an incentive for people who depend on assistance to have more children by increasing benefit payments, housing assistance, heating assistance, etc. on the basis of family size. I believe that making public assistance conditional on people who already have a child using reliable, reversible birth control, would correct the present [moral hazard] . By reliable birth control I mean IUDS and implants for women and the new [easily reversible vasectomies] for men after they pass clinical trials. I believe that this more balanced incentive scheme would be more fair to the middle class and the working poor. I believe it would also encourage people on public assistance to have children because they want them, not because they increase the amount of benefits they get from the state. I believe that a likely side benefit would be that people who really want more children would work that much harder to get off public assistance. I am under no illusion that this tweak to the social safety net would completely fix the moral hazard. I do believe, however, that it would still provide a massive benefit. I'll address some of the criticisms I've already heard so we can focus on the less obvious ones. If you think I've got these wrong, feel free to comment: 1. How would this apply to people who already have multiple children and need assistance later? People who have a family and then suffer a setback are not a large part of the overall picture because they are likely not going to stay on public assistance for the long term. Benefits should still be conditional on reliable birth control for people in this situation. 2. This proposal will inevitably be compared to the awful eugenics programs of the last two centuries. Is the current system itself not a form of eugenics, directed at the middle class and the working poor? 3. What about disabled people who genuinely cannot find well paying jobs? This is a very small proportion of the recipients of benefits. In the interest of fairness, people in this situation who truly cannot get decent jobs should be exempt. Deciding who belongs in this category and who doesn't will of course be a can of worms, but so is the current system. 4. What if people have their birth control reversed on their own? This isn't much different from traditional welfare fraud and should be treated the same way. 5. Welfare doesn't pay very much, so the whole dependency argument is a myth. This isn't true in many states. In 9 states welfare pays more than the average salary of a teacher. [Source] . In 7 states it pays better than 12 per hour job. Note that these figures don't include the difference in school taxes paid between working and middle class families and welfare recipients. If you live in public housing, you don't pay school tax. If you rent or own your home, you do, either directly or through your landlord. 6. Welfare isn't nearly as expensive as ""corporate welfare"" like tax loopholes, farm subsidies and free mineral rights. This is true, but the fact that those problems exist doesn't mean that this one isn't worth addressing too. Change my view. Edit: For those who disagree with me, I have a few questions. First, do you acknowledge that the moral hazard exists? Second, how would you change the current system, if at all? Edit 2: My proposal is that people who already have one child should be required to be on reliable birth control to continue to receive public benefits. Some people seem to be missing this part and it is important.",1,cmv_human
"The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, especially the fifth order WENO schemes, are a popular class of high order accurate numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). However when the spatial dimensions are high, the number of spatial grid points increases significantly. It leads to large amount of operations and computational costs in the numerical simulations by using nonlinear high order accuracy WENO schemes such as a fifth order WENO scheme. How to achieve fast simulations by high order WENO methods for high spatial dimension hyperbolic PDEs is a challenging and important question. In the literature, sparse-grid technique has been developed as a very efficient approximation tool for high dimensional problems. In a recent work [Lu, Chen and Zhang, Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly, 14 (2018) 57-86], a third order finite difference WENO method with sparse-grid combination technique was designed to solve multidimensional hyperbolic equations including both linear advection equations and nonlinear Burgers' equations. Numerical experiments showed that WENO computations on sparse grids achieved comparable third order accuracy in smooth regions of the solutions and nonlinear stability as that for computations on regular single grids. In application problems, higher than third order WENO schemes are often preferred in order to efficiently resolve the complex solution structures. In this paper, we extend the approach to higher order WENO simulations specifically the fifth order WENO scheme. A fifth order WENO interpolation is applied in the prolongation part of the sparse-grid combination technique to deal with discontinuous solutions. Benchmark problems are first solved to show that significant CPU times are saved while both fifth order accuracy and stability of the WENO scheme are preserved for simulations on sparse grids. The fifth order sparse grid WENO method is then applied to kinetic problems modeled by high dimensional Vlasov based PDEs to further demonstrate large savings of computational costs by comparing with simulations on regular single grids.",1,sci_gen_human
"Scientists have 3D printed cyanobacteria and graphene onto a mushroom in order to produce electricity. Shining a light on the cyanobacteria will kickstart their photosynthesis, which causes them to give off carbon dioxide. The mushrooms could be made from similar materials. The team had previously used LED lights to stimulate energy production within the fungus. However, they were unable to control the level of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere as they did not know how much CO2 was released each time it produced a photon of energy. The new technology allows for the first-time study of this effect by using a common light source and a widely used material added to the substrate. They are now working with researchers at the University of Twente, the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Centre Georges Pompidou (CGP) to investigate if future generations can benefit from the same technique. It would also enable scientists to print large quantities of the high performance materials without having to set up manufacturing facilities to produce these stones.",0,tldr_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b
"In the beginning it went well enough. A large supercomputer in the central citadel was maintained by rscience, rprogramming, rengineering and others like them who kept their dwellings close to the computer and ensured its smooth functioning. However, as time went on, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the supercomputer due to its complexity and the lack of resources and personnel. The people who had originally been employed to keep the computer running began to leave, taking their knowledge with them. As a result, many of the programs that ran the supercomputer became obsolete or were completely forgotten. Eventually, the computer was deemed too outdated and unreliable to be used for any important tasks, and was decommissioned. This left the citadel without a central computer, and the inhabitants had to find other ways to store and process data. The lack of a unified computing system meant that different areas of the citadel had to rely on individual computers and networks, which caused a variety of problems with communication, data storage, and security. Fortunately, the citadel was eventually able to acquire a new, more advanced supercomputer. This machine was able to handle the demands of the citadel's population and allowed for improved communication, data storage, and security.

"Parent company Mondelez says it plans to bring all Cadbury lines under its existing in-house fair trade scheme, Cocoa Life. As a result, it says it will offer five times more sustainable chocolate in the UK by 2019. But critics warn this could confuse consumers. They also fear that shared standards around ethical trade will be lost if more firms drop Fairtrade. So what prompted Mondelez's change of approach, and does it leave the future of the Fairtrade mark in doubt? Broadly, Fairtrade works as a voluntary certification system which holds adherents to strict standards - in particular paying a minimum price for raw materials such as cocoa, sugar and coffee. But Glenn Caton, northern Europe president at Mondelez, tells the BBC that while his firm and Fairtrade have the same goals, ""sustainability is about much more to us than price."" ""The next generation of farmers aren't taking on cocoa farming like they used to because it is so unprofitable, so we have to make sure their communities thrive and this means investing more in their communities,"" he says. As such, Mondelez wants to lead its own sustainability efforts - investing more in areas such as its supply chain, bonuses for farmers, training and climate change prevention. The Fairtrade Foundation has welcomed the move, too, which it says will leave farmers in developing countries like Ghana at least as well off, if not better-off. ""The relationship is not ending, it's changing,"" says policy and public affairs director Barbara Crowther, pointing out that the Fairtrade Foundation will remain a partner to Cocoa Life - independently assessing its progress and reporting its findings. The big question now is whether other firms will also choose to abandon Fairtrade certification and adopt their own systems of self-regulation. Certainly criticism of the Fairtrade system is mounting in the cocoa industry, says Dr Steve Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs. The big issue is that most cocoa producers are small farmers who can't achieve the economies of scale of bigger farms, and that leaves many vulnerable to risks like drought and struggling to survive. ""Fairtrade does bring benefits to some producers, but it will not be a way of transforming the world trade system as some people seem to see it,"" he says. ""The only way to improve conditions for people working at bottom of the supply chain - those farming raw materials like cocoa - is by investing in the supply chain. Price floors might help but will only go so far."" Another issue, says Tobias Webb, of supply chain consultancy the Innovation Forum, is that firms can find the web of overlapping ethical trade certifications out there complex to manage. These include not just Fairtrade's, but the Rainforest Alliance - which is dedicated to the conservation of tropical forests - and UTZ, the world's most prevalent label for sustainable farming. ""Producers can end up putting four or five labels on their products, and achieving each one requires a costly and time consuming audit. ""So many businesses like Mondelez are now moving towards in-house systems where they work in partnership with the NGOs as independent observers. But not everyone wants to see Fairtrade stepping back from its role as a leading promoter of ethical trade. Anna Taylor, executive director of think-tank the Food Foundation, says the UK has seen a ""rapid rise"" in Fairtrade sales in the last two decades which has been of huge benefit to farmers in the developing world. Fairtrade cocoa products by volume increased 6 in the UK in 2015, and around 4,500 products in 74 countries have the Fairtrade mark worldwide. The risk, she adds, is that we could lose a transparent set of universal standards that consumers ""trust, see and recognise."" ""Consumers more than ever want to be able to trust where their food comes from and are worried about'black-box' supply chains."" Mr Webb sees another potential risk in big firms pulling away from the Fairtrade system. ""Will NGOs still be able to resource themselves to play the role of the critical friend? There is potentially a risk there that there is no independent observer - but firms do understand they need that credibility."" Ms Crowther says the Fairtrade Foundation does not see Mondelez's move as a threat to its future, and welcomes companies ""taking ownership"" of their sustainability challenges. She adds that her organisation is also evolving to meet the cocoa industry's changing needs and moving beyond its historical focus on price regulation. ""If there is an opportunity to innovate in different way then we welcome it. It's also worth mentioning that Mondelez will continue to source the same amount of Fairtrade-certified sugar for its products. ""We are still the most recognisable ethical-trade mark globally and that's not going to change,"" she adds.",1,xsum_human

"User-generated reviews serve as crucial references in shopper's decision-making process. Moreover, they improve product sales and validate the reputation of the website as a whole. Thus, it becomes important to design reviews ranking methods that help shoppers make informed decisions quickly. However, reviews ranking has its unique challenges. First, there is no relevance labels for reviews. A relevant review for shopper A might not be relevant to shopper B. Second, since shoppers cannot click on reviews, we have no ways of getting relevance feedback. Eventually, reviews ranking suffers from the lack of ground truth due to the variability in the standard of relevance for different users. In this paper, we aim to address the challenges of helping users to find information they might be interested in from the sea of customer reviews. Using the Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset collected and organized by UCSD, we first constructed user profiles based on user's personal web trails, recent shopping history and previous reviews, incorporated user profiles into our ranking algorithm, and assigned higher ranks to reviews that address individual shopper's concerns to the largest extent. Also, we leveraged user profiles to recommend products based on reviews texts. We evaluated our model based on both empirical evaluations and numerical evaluations of review scores. The results from both evaluation methods reveal a significant increase in the quality of top reviews as well as user satisfaction for over 1000 products. Our reviews based recommendation system also suggests that there's a large chance of user viewing and liking the product we recommend. Our work shows the basic steps of developing a ranking method that learns from a particular end-user's preferences.",1,sci_gen_human
"Had a business lunch there today, and definitely will not be returning for the food. I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be terrible...but it didn't seem like they were giving their best food effort for the employees who did work here in the past (it seemed like they had an open door policy). The owner is very nice but the quality of the food has been lacking. There are an awful lot of bobbles on plates and bowls, lots of white spots inside the meat, etc. Quite disappointing but it's my own fault because I don't see how you can serve mediocre food when there isn't enough staff to actually make anything good happen?

"Kent Police has appealed to vigilante groups to stop taking the law into their own hands and leave the job of exposing paedophiles to the authorities. The call came amidst a rising trend of such groups operating in the United Kingdom to unmask those who they believe to be child abusers. The police stressed that vigilante groups were not the right means to address the issue, adding that their involvement could jeopardize the operation of the law and endanger people. The force warned that, while such groups might be operating under the guise of good intentions, their actions could, in fact, be harmful and dangerous. According to the police, vigilante groups can create chaos and confusion among the public, leading to innocent people being accused of paedophilia. They also run the risk of violating the privacy rights of alleged offenders, which could result in them being unable to get a fair trial. While the online hunting and shaming of paedophiles has been on the rise, the police have urged the public to report any allegations or suspicions to them, rather than to take matters into their own hands. The police have also assured the public that they have specialist teams equipped to investigate such crimes and would take prompt action to bring the offenders to justice. Kent Police emphasized that it recognizes the public's concerns and desire to tackle this issue, but stressed that the best way of doing so was to trust the police to carry out criminal investigations within the legal framework. In conclusion, the police called on members of the public to come forward and report any concerns that they may have about child abuse, rather than taking matters into their own hands. They also warned potential vigilantes that they would not escape prosecution if they took the law into their own hands.",0,xsum_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo

"The shovel bit deeply into the nearly frozen Kentucky soil. With a determined grunt, Jack Mastiff heaved a shovelful onto the growing mound of dirt next to the grave and peered over the side. Licking his lips, he scanned the surrounding area carefully then raised a flask to his mouth and took a long pull. Digging was thirsty work. Tossing the flask on top of his jacket, he quickly settled into the unholy chore. Dirt flew over the side as the temperature dropped. A full moon rose over the modest Calvary cemetery, washing out the colors and lending an urgency to his efforts. Jack jerked violently as his mobile phone vibrated in his back pocket. "" Goddamnit! "" He swore under his breath, jerking it from his pocket and answering it. The voice on the other end was cultured, vaguely european, and conveyed just a hint of a smile. Eddie had probably watched him jerk like a fish when the mobile went off in his pocket. "" What do you want, Eddie? "" "" You've got an hour until midnight. How are things coming along? "" "" Things would be faster if you were freezing your ass off and shoveling with me instead of interrupting every 15 minutes. "" "" Hallowed ground, buddy. You know I'd be there otherwise. "" "" Yeah, I know. "" Jack said, taking another pull from his flask. "" I'm nearly there. I'm not going to uncover the whole thing, just enough to get the job done. "" "" I was checking the lunar calendar while you've been busy and you're not going to get another opportunity for this until 2028. You need to make this count unless... "" Eddie let the sentence trail off. Jack knew what was unspoken. Unless he walked the dark path. Unless he used necromancy to preserve his body, to become an abomination, a Litch held together by magic of foul unpredictability. "" Don't interrupt me again unless you're coming in here to help. "" He snapped. "" That's not happening. "" Eddie said, always needing the last word. Jack redoubled his efforts and fought back the urge to drop the shovel and go throttle Eddie. Eddie was the facts guy, he checked things like places and dates and times. He was the perfect annoying counterpoint to Jack's innate abilities. Jack was a percipient, and facts always muddled his instinctive grasp of the worlds. But as much as Jack hated knowing the facts, his long time companion and business partner Eddie Savoie made sure he always had the facts, and just enough to feed that gnawing percipience inside his gut without overwhelming it. The shovel impacted the coffin with a hollow thunk that echoed loudly around the graveyard. Jack quickly cleared the dirt away and attacked the old wood with a hatchet, opening a gaping hole and exposing the mummified face of the man inside. Grabbing his kit from the side of the grave, Jack quickly spread his tools before him and prepared the ritual. A clay paten, dug and fired by his own hands, inscribed with a triquetra of his own blood. The arthame forged of nails pried from coffins, with a hilt of the blackest obsidian. His wand, 33 centimeters, carved from the bone of a living man. And finally, the chalice, a simple bowl of beaten copper which was given freely by someone who loved him. Of all the things that he had done, of all the arcane knowledge he had acquired, the chalice disturbed him most. It was a gift from Eddie, and unlike a simple linear gift, it bound their powers into a triangle which both fueled and fed upon itself. He filled it with holy water, then pricked his finger and allowed three fat drops of blood to fall within. Jack lit a tallow candle and the stink of unbaptized baby fat filled the grave. Midnight, and the world stood still for an eternal moment while he chanted softly, forcing the glottal invocations through his unwilling throat. Moonlight spilled into the coffin, illuminating the leathery skin stretched across the skull, gathering into silvery ropes, twisting into the spirit of a man dead these last three decades. "" Who summons me? "" it spoke in an etherial susurration. "" Happy birthday, Daddy. "" Jack said, smiling through clenched teeth. "" Let's talk about your suicide. """,1,wp_human
"United, who registered only one shot on target, fell behind when Alejandro Dominguez diverted home Giannis Maniatis's effort before the break. Arsenal loanee Joel Campbell's precise shot doubled the lead and the visitors only came to life late on. Robin van Persie blazed over the top when they finally opened up the Greeks. It would have been an injustice to the hosts had the Dutchman converted his late chance, however, after United's current limitations were exposed on a chastening night. Olympiakos lead the Greek Super League by 20 points, having won 24 of 26 games, in sharp contrast to their opponents' increasingly forlorn Premier League title defence. And, after reverses for Manchester City and Arsenal last week, the Greeks inflicted the third defeat of the round for English sides. Olympiakos manager Michel had suggested before kick-off that United, whose best hope of passage into next year's Champions League appeared to be winning this season's competition, could fold under the pressure of knockout football. The visitors, who were famously eliminated by Galatasaray in a similarly white-hot atmosphere in Istanbul in 1993, certainly fuelled the noisy home fans' enthusiasm with some early defensive wobbles. Media playback is not supported on this device After Rio Ferdinand had misplaced a couple of passes, a last-ditch challenge from Nemanja Vidic only just ended Dominguez's run after he had advanced into the area unchallenged. Dominguez continued to orchestrate Olympiakos's attacks from an advanced midfield role and with Juan Mata cup-tied, Adnan Januzaj left out of the match-day squad and Rooney frustrated by the referee and his own performance, the visitors lacked a similarly commanding figure. So it was fitting that it was the Argentine who opened the scoring. Maniatis's trundling low shot posed little danger to United goalkeeper David De Gea, but Dominguez's outstretched foot cleverly diverted the ball into the opposite corner giving the Spaniard too much ground to make up. United, who had lacked energy and invention, showed slightly more purpose before the break, but could not create any clear-cut chances, goalkeeper Roberto dealing competently with the visitors' crosses. The last time that Manchester United overturned a two-goal deficit in Europe was when they beat Diego Maradona's Barcelona 3-0 at Old Trafford in March 1984 in the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup. David Moyes's half-time team-talk needed to focus players' minds and change their tactics but neither was in evidence as Tom Cleverley knocked the ball out of play under no pressure soon after kick-off. A goal down, the visitors had no room for further error and Campbell's superb curling effort, after he slipped Michael Carrick's flimsy challenge, threatened to cut them adrift in the tie. Moyes introduced Shinji Kagawa and Danny Welbeck at the expense of Antonio Valencia and Cleverley, but it did little to change the momentum. Michael Olaitan sent a shot fizzing just over as the hosts revelled in the space and uncertainty in United's defence. Only in the final 10 minutes were United able to bring any pressure to bear, but, after two measured touches had given him a clear sight of goal, Van Persie crashed over the top with his weaker right foot from Chris Smalling's cross. It summed up a miserable new episode in Moyes's faltering first season in charge.",1,xsum_human

"The seahorse placenta is a fascinating example of convergent evolution. Male seahorses' brood pouches develop and function like human placentas. During pregnancy, the males provide embryos with everything they need. When these embryos are born in the uterus of an already-pregnant female, they can't use their sperm to fertilize eggs because no sperm cells have yet developed - so instead, they swim up into the amniotic fluid inside her body. That's when mom takes over for dad. In this scenario, the embryo isn't just sitting there waiting to be used, but it's swimming around inside Mom's womb too. This puts them at risk: They're exposed to contaminants from all sides as they start their journey to birth. In fact, one study reported that more than 50 percent of newborns tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infection after being in mother's wombs for about 12 hours. While most people do not get MRSA infections during pregnancy itself, pregnant women are at higher risk due to their increased susceptibility to staph infections. And mothers who have had previous MRSA infections may find themselves even more susceptible. As a result, you should avoid bathing or showering women who will soon become pregnant until after deliveries are complete.",0,tldr_machine_continuation_opt_1.3b
"It was an exciting time. One of the biggest advances in human history, and Jeremy of all people was the first to test it. Being massive science fiction fans, we were so excited for the opportunity we never really thought about what might happen to him. They said he would spend about a month away, between all the protocols that had been set up and the actual ""traveling"" itself. I couldn't wait to see him again, to hear all the stories of everything he had done. Our families threw a massive return party for him. Everyone wanted to see him again and hear his stories, including the mass of reporters that gathered in the driveway. We eventually got the knock on the door we had all been waiting for, Jeremy walked in the door calmer than I had ever seen him. The luster in his eyes that everyone knew Jeremy for, ever since he was a baby, was gone. The party and the interviews went through all the motions. Everyone could tell something was obviously wrong with him, the expexted excitement of the party never came to be and all the reporters' questions were rather bluntly ignored. I wanted nothing more than to talk to my friend again, to find out what had happened to him. After over six months of silence, Jeremy finally opened up to me. He spoke of places and events so grand that they were beyond description. Dinosaurs roaming the earth, watching our earliest ancestors leave their caves for the first time, even humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial life. As he described these things his face truly lit up for the first time since he left. He also told tales of darker times. Tales of a war that would rend the world uninhabitable. Ash clouds that blocked the sun for decades, sending mankind back into the caves from which he watched them emerge not so long ago. I finally realized what had taken the gleam from my friend's eyes. He had seen millenia worth of death and destruction, becoming merely a shell of the friend I once knew. No one ever meaningfully heard from Jeremy again. He became a recluse and took his own life not long after. To this day he is known the world over as a symbol of man's potential as well as man's arrogance. I can only hope his story is remembered, both for the friend he was and the future his sacrifice may be able to prevent.",1,wp_human

While he had enjoyed being a part of the team, fighting for justice and freedom, he felt it was time for him to move on to something else. He hung up his shield and uniform with a sense of sadness, but also a feeling of accomplishment and pride in all the battles he had fought and won. Steve chose to settle down in a small neighborhood just outside of the city. He wanted to live somewhere where he could be anonymous and enjoy the peace and quiet of a simpler life.

"Due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday evenings. This increased competition for viewers because customers could choose between six different television programs competing with each other along with two movies broadcast simultaneously at 6:30 pm Eastern Time (ET). The most successful of these shows were Abbott Costello's comic skits that aired during Studio One (1953-55), which featured many future stars including Bob Hope; Red Skelton; Lucille Ball; Eddie Cantor; Robert Stack; Johnny Carson; George Burns; Esther Williams; Milton Berle; Jane Wyman; Joan Crawford and Debbie Reynolds.

"I have only watched Musk's presentation, so there might be details elsewhere that I have missed. The main purpose of the shingles is aesthetics. These solar shingles are designed to look like regular house shingles. This starts serving the community who had the money and desire for solar power but did not want the big ugly panels. Unless there is an efficiency edge (I don't think so) or a decreased cost edge (He kept saying they were a similar price of a regular roof, but I have no numbers to back up this claim) the only thing these new shingles do is aesthetics. Powerwall is a newer technology that is supposed to solve the problem of uneven use and generation. Solar panels only make energy during the day, but people still use energy at night. Powerwall is just a giant battery that will store your solar power made in the day, and let you use it at night. Again, batteries are not new, but the affordability of giant batteries is a new thing. Also note, he specifically says that he does not intend for this kind of technology to replace utilities. He says if we get off gas heating and gas cars, we will triple the amount of electricity we need. That means we need to increase production by three times of what we currently do.,"" ""Only for one problem they solve: The current traditional solar setup is problematic for high wind areas like Florida, Louisiana, tornado alley etc. This is due to the extra nailscrew holes for mounting and the possibility of water penetration. Water getting past the mounts and softening the wood (plywood that the roof covers) added with high winds under the panels creates a sail like a sailboat. This can create a bigger hole and roof leaks so not only can it be a problem for the homeowner but also for them to have wind mitigation insurance (hurricane insurance). There are some integrated solar solutions that have the blue or black panels in between roof shingles like John Cena's house and also some flat solutions for rubber or roll down flat roofs. It's not a completely new idea for integrated solar, but rather a more elegant and functional solution. I'm most excited for the Mediterranean claycement style tile roofs because the individual tiles can break more easily than other roof styles. I would look into replacing my current roof in 5-8 years with a Tesla roof.,Has anyone seen information on individual tiles are connected? Does each tile have a and - terminal, all of which need to be connected together? Could a miswiring ""short out"" your whole roof?', ""No one knows what the future of solar holds. I feel strongly that adoption is going to become more and more ubiquitous. Prices keep getting lower. What form factor we will we see on homes remains to be seen. I think there is room for a larger more squarish panel that is more integrated than current style. Here may also be room for tiles like Musk's. I have been in the solar industry in California for 14 years. I started with a company that was doing this exact thing. Back then, no one thought that homeowners would ever go for the big rectangle panels. They were considered very ugly back then (still are to many) Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics (BIPV) was what the industry thought was needed. Unfortunately BIPV performs much worse than regular panels. Solar panels run on photons from the sun, but they really don't like the heat part of the sunlight. Heat cuts down on performance significantly (0.5 drop per deg C). When you have a panel that is flush to the roof, no air circulates around the panel. So a flush panel always loses versus a box panel with a gap for air to flow. On the technical side, it's tough to make these. Imagine all the connnections. Where are the wires and plugs? What about the heat? Suntech's modules of this sort were literally burning houses down due to serious heat related issues. Can they be made at a reasonable price? Are the labor costs going to be too high? Will this be a niche item for high end customers? I worked for SolarCity for 8 years. A big part of what drove us to success was the move from BIPV to regular panels. We made it cool to put regular panels on your roof. The cynic in me says these tiles are a vaporware distraction by Elon Musk to build the hype to continue the momentum he needs to get the SolarCity Tesla merger done. The bright side part of me hopes they really have something here. This has been tried for 20 years and the ground is littered with failures. Huge companies have tried and given up. Unisun, Suntech, BP, Dow Corning, etc.,"" ""Just finish a university paper on the powerwall. Powerwall, although being the most unexpensive home energy storage system at the moment it still is very expensive to invest for your home, unless you have solar panels and a multi-function inverter already paid-off. Mainly because of the savings on the electricy bill aren't big enough to cover the investment. Another reason is the application you give it.... if its meant for a daily usage the battery life goes considerably down and a newer investment on a new battery is needed before you can have the payback of the original powerwall. An this is why Powerwall isn't ubiquity, but Home Energy Battery Systems will become a thing in a near future when the manufacture of lithium increases (main compound of the powerwall and similiar techs). Lithium is fairly east to come by nowadays, since it comes from salt. Edit1: an inverter, is a switch that toggles the source where you get your power from. From the eletrical grid or from the solar panels.,they mean something today. if you were building a house right now, it would be a good idea to get that tesla set up, batterysolar tiles. the solar tiles themselves arent that huge of an idea but the advance battery pack the system makes it very easy to do.', Aesthetics: no ""ugly"" panels sticking up above the roof - Longer life: when compared to regular shingles - Insulation: glass is an excellent insulator, Musk briefly mentions this in his presentation. Would be great in northern states. - More durable: video shows nice demo of being hit with direct force - Power generation: certainly less efficient than a panel system because trade-offs were made for aesthetics, but makes up for it in a few ways. 1) greater area covered, look at traditional panels, they only cover part of the roof, this would cover the whole thing. 2) Not all panels face south allowing capture during all times of the day instead of losing late-afternoon or early-morning sun with south-only facing panels (URL0). 3) If install truly is easier as claimed then more houses will have it 4) No more pre-planning for installation, hiring a solar company to assess your site to determine whether installation on your house makes sense - if you need a new roof you just install this instead, similar process and similar effort to a regular roof making it a practical option even for those who would normally never think twice about installing solar. As to how they work, I can only assume they've developed a click-together system to make quick install with special pieces for the top and edges. IMHO there would be no point in distributing a product much more complicated than this; their company doesn't already have a network of installation specialists so spending a little extra on R D up front to make it installable by someone with minimal training would make sense for them. If you think about Tesla, Musk already has a network of supercharger stations all over the US even before tesla has become numerous enough to make sense to allow rapid growth of tesla as able. If these needed specialized equipment I would have expected him and the company to already be involved in developing a network of installers and companies to train them. Lets say these shingles pan out and are a practical and cost effective roofing alternative, we're probably about one, maybe two, generations away from general use. to amp up production in a meaningful way I would estimate would take 5-10 years (look at how long it's taken Tesla to increase production from small-scale to large-scale production although subtract some time from this number because they've got the gigafactory already rolling). there will likely be some adustments, recalls and bugs to work out in the first few years. the majority of people won't adopt this until it's been proven for a decently long period of time, and then the rate of replacement of a roof is 20 years so most people wouldn't switch over until they're due for a new one even once the practicality and longevity is proven. TLDR: I'm going to go out on a limb here and guessing that this will be wildly successful technology that will ultimately help decentralize power generation for all the reasons listed above, but will still take a long time to become ubiquitous.','doesnt it also solve for sunlight aspect? ie, some tiles are always sun facing. although maybe they are not as efficient, and make up for it in coverage and exposure','There's supposed to be a cost edge.

"Correlative microscopy is a methodology combining the functionality of light microscopy with the high resolution of electron microscopy and other microscopy technologies. Image registration for correlative microscopy is quite challenging because each pixel in an image needs to be registered against one or more reference points. A typical method uses multiple references, divided into two groups: ""pre-registration"" (i.e., pre-registered pixels) and post-registration (pixels that have been moved after acquisition). The problem of pre-registering all pixels prior to signal reconstruction occurs at large scales; it requires large amounts of memory and processing power, thereby affecting the performance of the system. Post-registration only addresses this issue when there are many small changes in the scene as opposed to large changes such as large scale additions or deletions of features on existing objects. Consequently, to fully exploit the spatial information contained in an image, methods such as histogram matchingcorrelation must be applied. Histograms allow the correlation between consecutive images to be computed over time by removing noise from the data since the same point appears once within an image. Two approaches to histogram matching include simple statistical methods such as Gaussian filtering and classification (e.g., Mean Field Fraction Classification), adaptive clustering algorithms (such as Markov Chains), and optimal optimization techniques (including the Maximum Entropy Theorem, Maximum Intrinsic Goodness Principle, and Poisson Distribution). However, these methods suffer from various deficiencies including being prone to sampling biases, needing to be accurate even across noisy samples, not taking advantage of the temporal information present in images, requiring the use of specialized hardware, and making assumptions about how the data was acquired.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b

"The big political parties didn't make much of it during the campaign. Both the Conservatives and Labour are broadly in favour, though the Greens are very critical. TTIP was however addressed in the manifestos. War on Want (who oppose the plans) have compiled the parties' positions on the issue. Outside the political arena there are some very strong opinions. Many business voices are enthusiastic, but there is also very vocal opposition. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or it will be if the negotiations are completed. The aim is to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment. President Obama said, when the talks were launched, that TTIP would promote ""new growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."" Critics reject that claim - more of that below. A study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) - done for the European Commission - estimated the potential gains for the EU as up to EUR119bn (PS85bn; 134bn) a year and EUR95bn (PS68bn; 107bn) for the US. For a family of four that comes to EUR545 per year in the EU and EUR655 in the US. Wages would be higher, by 0.5 in the EU and just under 0.4 in the US. The CEPR has done a more specific estimate of the benefits for the UK, which suggested gains in annual national income of up to PS10bn. By eliminating almost all tariffs (taxes applied only to imported goods) on trade between the US and the EU. But the tariffs imposed by the US and EU are already relatively low for the most part, although there are some exceptions in, for example, farm produce and textiles. The bigger gains envisaged would come from reducing what are called non-tariff barriers. In particular the two sides think they can promote trade through what they call regulatory co-operation. This is about costs to business. Complying with regulations involves a cost. A firm that wants to export may incur further costs meeting the regulatory requirements of the country it's selling into. The European Commission says that rules in Europe and the US often achieve the same level of consumer safety and product quality, but differ in their technical details and their methods for ensuring that firms have met the rules. One of the aims of TTIP is to reduce this burden on business. One option is recognising one another's standards. That's under consideration for many types of goods. They also plan to co-operate more closely on new regulation. That basic idea is that by reducing the cost of exporting, TTIP would encourage more of it. The idea here is to encourage transatlantic foreign investment. The European Commission says an agreement in this area would prohibit discrimination against foreign investors, expropriation, denying access to the courts and arbitrary and abusive treatment. If a foreign investor felt these rules had been violated, they would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. This is a system of tribunals that could award compensation to the investor if they had lost money as a result of a breach of the rules in the agreement. Regulation Much of the concern is about the regulatory aspect: that it would lead to lower standards of consumer and environmental protection and safety at work. A group of 170 European civil society organisations said in a statement that regulatory co-operation as envisaged in TTIP would result in ""downward harmonisation."" There is also a concern that TTIP could undermine governments' right to regulate in the public interest. They say it will also give business groups a disproportionate influence over new regulation, and therefore, they argue, it is undemocratic. Economic benefits Others question the analysis behind claims that TTIP will be economically beneficial. Jeronim Capaldo of Tufts University in the US says the European Commission's study makes unrealistic assumptions about how easy it would be for workers who lose their jobs to find new employment. He argues that Europe would actually be worse off, in terms of economic activity, wages and government revenue. Investment There are also questions about whether a TTIP agreement would really stimulate more investment. A London School of Economics Study for the British Department of Business, Innovation, and Skills concluded that an investment chapter would be ""highly unlikely to encourage investment above and beyond what would otherwise take place."" ISDS has generated a lot of heated opposition. One complaint is that it will discourage governments from regulating in the public interest. Olivier Hoedeman of Corporate Europe Observatory, a Brussels-based campaign group, said it would act as a ""chill factor"" on governments who would fear that business regulation might lead to protracted legal challenges and bills for compensation. ISDS arrangements are common in international investment agreements. But research by the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development suggests investors have made more use of the tribunal system in recent years. Perhaps the most high-profile - some would say notorious - examples were the actions taken by the tobacco company Philip Morris against Uruguay and Australia over new rules on the packaging of their products, rules intended to make them less attractive to consumers. Neither case has been completed. There is a particular concern expressed by British campaigners about the possible impact of ISDS on the National Health Service. There is, they argue, a danger that if a government wants to reverse any arrangements to contract services out to private suppliers, it might risk being sued under ISDS. European and British officials insist that TTIP's ISDS provisions won't have that effect, but many campaigners don't believe it. A summit of European leaders in December called for a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2015, though the European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has said that is probably unrealistic. That will be challenging, given the technical complexity and the vigorous opposition. It would then have to be approved by the European Parliament and European Trade Ministers. The Ministers usually vote on trade by what is called qualified majority though unanimity might be required - that is both a legal question and a matter of political judgement. Depending on the legal nature of the final agreement it might also need to be approved by all the EU member states, and Commissioner Malmstrom has said that is likely to be necessary. So there is plenty of scope for delays. And it will need approval by the US Congress. President Obama is struggling unsuccessfully so far - to get Congress to give him what is called Trade Promotion Authority which would make US ratification less difficult. There is a global trade negotiation under way in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It's known as the Doha Round, because that is where it was launched - back in 2001. It has been very slow. At the end of 2013 the WTO members finally agreed a part of that agenda. It's called the Trade Facilitation Agreement and it's about the mechanics of international commerce - customs procedures, for example. The really hard stuff is still not agreed. Trade Facilitation is sometimes called the Doha Round's ""low-hanging fruit,"" yet it still took 12 years to pick. Frustration with the slow pace has led many countries to pursue bilateral and regional deals. The WTO's Director General Roberto Azevedo has said: ""These initiatives are important for the multilateral (global) trading system - but they do not substitute it."" The other really big example is the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which involves 11 countries, including the US and Japan (but not China). TPP is also still under negotiation.",1,xsum_human

"During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration interviewed thousands of former slaves about their life experiences. While these interviews are crucial to understanding the ""peculiar institution"" from the standpoint of the slave himself, issues relating to bias cloud analyses of these interviews. The problem I investigate is the problem of candour in the WPA slave narratives: it is widely held in the historical community that the strict racial caste system of the Deep South compelled black ex-slaves to tell white interviewers what they thought they wanted to hear. Since no such stiff racial divide existed between the ex-slaves and black interviewers, it stands to reason the topics discussed and sentiments expressed in front of black interviewers differed significantly from those discussed in front of white interviewers. In this work, I attempt to quantitatively characterise this race-related problem of candour. Prior work has either been of an impressionistic, qualitative nature, or utilised exceedingly simple quantitative methodology. In contrast, I use more sophisticated statistical methods: in particular word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and comparative topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation to try and identify differences in the content and sentiment expressed by ex-slaves in front of white interviewers versus black interviewers. While my sentiment analysis methodology was ultimately unsuccessful due to the complexity of the task, my word frequency analysis and comparative topic modelling methods both showed strong evidence that the content expressed in front of white interviewers was different from that of black interviewers. In particular, I found that the ex-slaves spoke much more about unfavourable aspects of slavery like whipping and slave patrollers in front of interviewers of their own race. While these aren't particularly surprising or unknown results, I hope that my more-sophisticated statistical methodology helps improve the robustness of the argument for the existence of this problem of candour in the slave narratives, which some would seek to deny for revisionist purposes. Finally, I found further utility for the results of the comparative topic modelling by using them predict the race of interviews for whom the interviewer was unknown using a simple k -nearest neighbours method on the topics discussed in the interview. This method hopefully will allow historians to better utilise the hundreds of interviews for which the race of the interviewer is unknown, which are usually discarded due to their hitherto unascertainable source of bias.",1,sci_gen_human

"Calls to reward them for their heroics are coming from politicians along with news and social media. Suspect Jaber al-Bakr gave elite commandos the slip over the weekend, sparking a two-day manhunt. Police believe Mr Bakr was planning to bomb a Berlin airport. The country's best-selling daily newspaper Bild dubbed the refugee trio the ""Syrian heroes of Leipzig."" Politicians from across the spectrum recommended them for the Federal Cross of Merit, a rank in Germany's civilian honours system. Ansgar Heveling, chairman of the parliamentary committee on interior affairs, went a step further and called on them to be granted asylum. Fellow Syrian refugees have also taken to social media to praise their compatriots. Police had been watching Mr Bakr, 22, for months, but he evaded police surveillance on Saturday in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, just as the authorities were preparing to storm an apartment where he was staying. Mr Bakr, who is also Syrian, made his way south to Leipzig and asked for help and shelter from the trio, who later recognised Mr Bakr as a suspect after seeing police's appeals for information in Arabic on Facebook. They quickly overpowered the fugitive, tied him up, and called police. ""I was furious with him, I couldn't accept something like this - especially here in Germany, the country that opened its doors to us,"" one of the men told RTL Television.

"In this paper, we apply angle-domain Doppler compensation for high-mobility wideband massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uplink transmission. The time-varying multipath channel is considered between high-speed terminal and static base station (BS), where multiple Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs) are associated with distinct angle of departures (AoDs). With the aid of the large-scale uniform linear array (ULA) at the transmitter, we design a beamforming network to generate multiple parallel beamforming branches, each transmitting signal pointing to one particular angle. Then, the transmitted signal in each branch will experience only one dominant DFO when passing over the time-varying channel, which can be easily compensated before transmission starts. We theoretically analyze the Doppler spread of the equivalent uplink channel after angle-domain Doppler compensation, which takes into account both the mainlobe and sidelobes of the transmit beam in each branch. It is seen that the channel time-variation can be effectively suppressed if the number of transmit antennas is sufficiently large. Interestingly, the asymptotic scaling law of channel variation is obtained, which shows that the Doppler spread is proportional to the maximum DFO and decreases approximately as 1 M (M is the number of transmit antennas) when M is sufficiently large. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed scheme.",1,sci_gen_human

"We consider the problem of learning a non-deterministic probabilistic system consistent with a given finite set of positive and negative tree samples. Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation models, that assume there exists an optimal policy in terms of computational cost for each decision variable (that essentially represents all information about possible outcomes). The main result shows how we can augment these simple models to allow arbitrary model structure on trees, beyond just having two branches or one branch at both ends; this also allows sampling from more than two distributions simultaneously using backtracking methods based only on conditional independence relations between variables rather then explicit backward induction algorithms such as those employed by Shinya Yamanaka. We further show that combining consistency guarantees with our method yields extremely efficient tree search and guarantee remarkably tight bounds on the expected number of steps necessary to learn tree with arbitrarily high coverage rate under certain assumptions. All results are illustrated through numerical examples applied to various problems, including denoising images, topological data analysis, and robust optimization. Discovery Science Study Reveals Impact Of Personalized Medicine On Medical Research In Japan - Why Are Cancer Patients Treated Differently? New scientific evidence lays out why cancer patients may be treated differently depending upon their genetic profile. A recent study published online today finds cancer research has been significantly impacted by personalized medicine. Published in Genetics in Medicine[1], ""Personalizing medical care: an overview"" describes Japanese doctors' adoption of targeted therapies medications that target specific genes mutated during disease development which have dramatically altered conventional treatment approaches toward precision medicine since March 2003 when nearly half of newly diagnosed cancers were found to contain mutations in known tumor suppressor genes.[2] However, due largely in part to cultural barriers against genomic testing among physicians,[34] researchers say it's still unclear if patient response rates differ according to whether they receive standard therapy or therapeutic targeting. When compared side-by-side across five different types of breast cancers, the authors [5],[6] note approximately 35 percent fewer women receiving chemotherapy responded positively versus 34 percent being responsive while undergoing targeted hormone blockade medication. This trend was replicated in gastric carcinoma where 37 respond favorably after chemotherapy but 48 do so following hormonal manipulation. These findings could suggest that some people won't benefit equally from either approach despite equal survival chances, creating room for new treatments outside traditional paradigms. While acknowledging several limitations preventing generalizability of the current observational studies over time and geography namely not knowing what type (s) of tumors progressed and which didn't - they speculate other factors play into eventual outcome noting younger age plays role incertain cancers whereas smoking status might contribute elsewhere.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_30b

"Apple has been criticized for placing its own apps at the top of the App Store search results. While Apple denies the accusations, an analysis of search terms showed that iPhone searches are frequently directed to the first page and often include ""iPad"" as a qualifier; while Android users primarily seek out Google apps in their app stores. In reaction to this controversy over what some call 'walled gardens,' Mozilla is working on mobile-first web browsers which would not only bring browsing experience closer to native iOS or Android applications but also ensure user data privacy by default. The browser maker recently revealed plans to develop Firefox OS with two major updates - the 1.0 version will offer better performance and more customization features than the previous versions while 2.0 will make use of HTML5 Web APIs such as geolocation API, Canvas element, error handling support, device orientation detection etc. Developers can now build single view hybrid application using Apache Cordova framework, a cross platform development toolkit for building native mobile applications using HTMLCSS JavaScript (or any other client side programming language). Building first time Android and iOS apps from scratch becomes easy using Phonegap, while advanced developers have several options like Ionic Framework for AngularJS based frameworks, Sencha Touch or Titanium Studio and many others available on the market today.

Browser Based Apps Using React Native: There are plenty of reasons why people want to create apps for both desktop and mobile platforms. One trend has emerged where companies prefer developing a single code base across all these platforms instead of creating separate UI kits. If we look back into history, Facebook was one of the pioneers who came up with a new approach called react-native which offers a way to implement common patterns without having to rework entire systems. This helps lead apps towards seamless integration between multiple devices. Another important feature offered by react-native is how it works with third party libraries and plugins.

"Recently, Malaysia, Australia, and China have declared the next possible step in their search for the lost Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. They mentioned that they have a cautious optimism that they will soon locate the plane. In May, after finishing the ongoing search in the priority zone, the three countries will review their methods for locating the aircraft. During a tripartite meeting, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack expressed optimism that the plane would be located within the present search region in the southern Indian Ocean. Nonetheless, he stressed the importance of the three nations to prepare themselves for a probable subsequent stage of the investigation. McCormack stated the significance of preparing for the upcoming stage of the search to guarantee that the on-going efforts are maximally fruitful. He stated that representatives of the three nations are planning to convene in June to determine which regions to explore further. At present, the nations are directing their attention towards the search zone of 120,000 square kilometers in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. The airplane carrying 239 passengers from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 is expected to have crashed there. So far, the quest to locate the aircraft has been the most intricate and costly one in the annals of air travel, with an expenditure exceeding 150 million. Earlier explorations have discovered multiple sunken vessels, yet no indication of the airplane has been detected. Several years after the initial search for the plane was halted in January 2017 due to a dearth of fresh evidence, there is a possibility of resuming the pursuit. The Malaysian government enlisted the services of private company Ocean Infinity in 2018 to resume the search for MH370. The company provided a ""no-find, no-fee"" arrangement. Numerous explanations have been put forth about the airplane's vanishing, including but not limited to hijacking, pilot murder-suicide, and a potential blaze on the aircraft. Despite the various hypotheses proposed, none of them have been substantiated yet, and since there is no proof uncovered, the investigation persists as uncertain.",0,cnn_gpt4_para
"This paper introduces Distributed Stein Variational Gradient Descent (DSVGD), a non-parametric generalized Bayesian inference framework for federated learning. DSVGD maintains a number of non-random and interacting particles at a central server to represent the current iterate of the model global posterior. The particles are iteratively downloaded and updated by one of the agents with the end goal of minimizing the global free energy. By varying the number of particles, DSVGD enables a flexible trade-off between per-iteration communication load and number of communication rounds. DSVGD is shown to compare favorably to benchmark frequentist and Bayesian federated learning strategies, also scheduling a single device per iteration, in terms of accuracy and scalability with respect to the number of agents, while also providing well-calibrated, and hence trustworthy, predictions.",1,sci_gen_human

"As a cat, sort of, fabric-and-stitching construct in a human gait, I find myself sauntering around ordinary people whose heads swivel and eyes bugger, breaking into eager whispers. Look, don't tell anyone, but there's a cat fitted with a body-worn camera walking the streets of London. The device is called 'Kittycam' - it was devised by The Pussycat Foundation as part of its campaign to raise awareness about pet care in Britain where more than 4 million cats are currently homeless or living on the street. It's also another bizarre example of wildlife tech that makes me think: ""In my day we had animals which were already equipped with cameras! Why do they need these?"" This isn't one of those times, though... ""Being an animal has never been this easy,"" says Kittycam founder Tom Bosworth (who didn't actually invent the thing) from his home office in south London. He explains how he stumbled across some footage of a cat being attacked by dogs during lockdown, and thought: ""That looked pretty dangerous."" That made him start thinking deeply about what technology could be used for rescue work, not just surveillance. ""I said if we can attach a GoPro to dogs then surely we can attach one to cats."" For obvious reasons. Bosworth explains that cameras aren't designed especially well for cats. Their lightweight frames become vulnerable to getting knocked over; their batteries tend to get overheated at high temperatures; their lenses distort when they try to capture fast motion. It'll take years before any company develops something suitable for both humans and felines. So Bosworth got started designing something himself. He tinkered around with different designs until finally coming up with a prototype built out of stretchy mesh like a sleeping bag. When your cat steps onto the frame, pressure sensors trigger a Bluetooth beacon so that footage gets uploaded to a phone app. You're still limited for quality because you have to use a fixed lens attached as close as possible to the front end of the camera, but it works perfectly fine indoors and doesn't interfere with movement too much. And once he'd worked everything out, Bosworth decided to crowdfund the project through Kickstarter. Bosworth admits he shouldn't really have tried to fund a cat-camera at a time when everyone else needed urgent medical equipment, but he wouldn't let that stop him. In fact, crowdfunding allowed him to gather more information from actual owners about what problems they faced. What issues did they face? How often does it fail to record events? Which breeds work best? Cats who hate being enclosed inside, cats who love hiding under beds... There was such a huge array of various requirements, including the necessity to include a way for owners to remove unwanted kitties safely without disturbing them. ""We couldn't ignore those things, otherwise it would fail."" Then came the question of prices. People generally expect to pay a premium for luxury items. But asking for 350 for a piece of kit that will only last two weeks might seem insanely steep. Then again, people would probably worry enough about their pets while stuck inside all day to justify spending quite a lot. And it seems most of them do. Kittycam quickly raised almost half a million pounds from 962 backers. And now it's going global. Anyone willing to buy a pair for 369 (290), plus shipping costs, can receive one from June this year. Embedded in each unit is a waterproof speaker so that sound recordings are heard even when the battery dies. And since cats don't respond very well to loud noises, owners should be able to hear their furry friends calling for help anywhere outside the house thanks to the speakers. There's definitely nothing novel about using animal tracking devices to find lost children (a story covered here previously). But there remains something interesting in seeing what happens when animals evolve beyond our control. Maybe somewhere down the line we won't have a choice but to come to terms with it.",0,wp_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b

"I knocked on the golden door tentatively, waiting for an answer. But nobody answered. I motioned to the other angels to circle the building. ""We know you're boarded up in there. Now come out or we'll have to engage with force."" Still no reply. I slammed the door open with the weight of my back, golden staff in my hand, searching the room for some living figure. I needed to search the building. First the living room. A bright ray shining through a window, I checked the perimeter of the room. Nothing. All that was left was a torn bible on the floor along with a shattered cross. I walked back outside and reported back to the squad. ""Well, Mark? Did you find anything?"" ""Nothing except this."" I handed him the torn up bible while looking around, checking to see if perhaps the target had escaped. ""Huh."" Luke turned the bible in his hand. ""I got a report back from the other squad. They said they may have found..... him hiding in sector four. You wan na go check it out?"" I shrugged wearily, staring off into the distance. A large fire at the horizon, it nearly engulfed my view.

"So I'll start off by saying that in no way am I promoting the ""gluten free diet"" or any other so called ""fad"" diets such as paleo, keto etc... Essentially what you are doing is taking a wheat low carb grain and replacing it with something else. The same thing was done to dutch pastry for over 200 years until they discovered how to store their high fat ""cake"" better without using flour - after all, baking powder only exists thanks to it's high starch content! First of all, to anyone who actually thinks this will work: Well firstly, there is 5 different types of gluten-free foods on the market today (more coming soon) ranging from rice cakes, breads, pasta, milk products like ice creammilk and so much more! So clearly people have been looking into this for many years now and we know just by visiting websites and reading product labels that these complex carbohydrates are NOT healthy for our bodies. And if you can't believe me try drinking 1 glass of red wine everyday - that has less than 4 grams of carbs per glass yet is considered healthy? Our bodies need carbs and proteins to function properly which is why we eat them but when you replace one type of carbohydrate (wheat flour) with another your body doesn't have the capacity to process everything at once and hence you end up feeling full quickly because of the lack of digestion! This isn't to say that other grains are harmful either but please get real - how could any other wheat be healthier then white or brown rice??? Secondly, what is this supposed to offer as a substitute? If you take away gluten, you don't make certain food groups safe anymore right? Well you're wrong! Gluten-free breads are 100 fine if consumed daily as part of a balanced diet.. However do not substitute for actual grains such as wheat nor should they be used to fill out meals unless specifically advised otherwise by a doctor! In terms of weight loss they certainly aren't going to help most people lose weight but moderate to severe cases of Celiac disease and Asperger syndrome (both very common in those born with disorders of glycolysis, the conversion of sugar to energy) may benefit from consuming the new variety of whole grains (especially buckwheat)! Lastly, this isn't even a fad diet, this is simply an alternative that provides a slower rate of carbohydrates consumption while still providing the essential vitamins and minerals needed to maintain good health. A quick search for vegetarianism shows us that 90of vegetarians live a plenty healthy lifestyle despite eating meat along with plenty of vegetables, fruits and legumes!! Why would anyone wanting to be healthy go around trying to eliminate all foods that contain protein???? As always my advice is to consult with your GP before making any changes to your diet and keep in mind that a great deal of our health comes down to the quality of our interactions with our environment (i.e. air pollution levels, chemical contamination levels etc.) so choose wisely where you spend your time!!",0,cmv_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b

"The meat inside is firm and flavorful. Shedders have softer shells, since they have recently moulted. They are also less likely to mate when molting than other hermit crabs. Eggs: Each female crab will lay about four eggs per year. The eggs take six weeks to hatch. When the larvae first emerge from their larval stage (about half an inch long), they can survive for a week or so by eating bacteria in sand. Most of them die within three days, though some live on as adults. Larvae may be eaten by birds, fish, other crustaceans such as Anopinella sp., or even cannibalized by crabs with soft-shelled eggs.

"Health management of complex dynamic systems has traditionally evolved separately from automated control, planning, and scheduling (generally referred to in the paper as decision making). A goal of Integrated System Health Management has been to enable coordination between system health management and decision making, although successful practical implementations have remained limited. This paper proposes that, rather than being treated as connected, yet distinct entities, system health management and decision making should be unified in their formulations. Enabled by advances in modeling and computing, we argue that the unified approach will increase a system's operational effectiveness and may also lead to a lower overall system complexity. We overview the prevalent system health management methodology and illustrate its limitations through numerical examples. We then describe the proposed unification approach and show how it accommodates the typical system health management concepts.",1,sci_gen_human
"excuse my style, i just got up and need caffeine. I'd been waiting for my girlfriend for nearly twenty minutes now, and I was sure that the entire restaurant knew that I had been stood up. Fuck it, I was too hungry to deal with this. I'd probably order food anyway. This had been our last chance to fix our relationship. Since the day she cheated on me, everything had changed so much. I wanted to love her, but I didn't, and some part of me knew that I couldn't. I don't really know what happened between us. I always took care of her, I always did everything I could for her. Her casual abuse made me constantly feel like I just wasn't doing as much as I should. Fuck her. She was probably laughing at the idea of me sitting alone in some shitty diner right now, completely ignoring how much I had cared about her, how much I had done for her. Maybe she was with that handsome douchebag she'd fucked before. It was his problem now. A strange kind of anger was building up inside me, one I had never felt before. I didn't want to flip tables over or hit things or shout, and I didn't care about the bitch at all anymore. I was angry at myself, not at her. She was a shitty person, but how could I change that? All I can change is myself, and I should have stopped accepting these torrents of abuse a long time ago. I was going to move on, because I was just simply so tired of this shit. There wasn't an instant burden lifted off my mind, and I didn't automatically stop feeling like shit, but the more I thought about it, the more I understood my freedom. I could do whatever I wanted. Maybe I'd live in the city with no friends or family- I'd never liked people anyway. Maybe I'd move to Hawaii, spend my days in a tropical paradise. There was nothing tying me here anymore.

"The key is that in a true RPG you're playing the role, not just playing the game. In a lot of games out there, you might HAVE a role but you're not truly PLAYING that role. Look at the old classics like Space Invaders where you're a laser cannon that can move back and forth. You can't have a conversation with your support crew, you can't pick up and move stuff around, you don't control anything at all about your existence except moving left, moving right, and firing. Your role as a laser cannon is completely restricted and rigid. So you play the game and completely ignore the role. Same applies to other games like golf simulators - you can't control much at all beyond swing and club selection. Your character has no personality, no relationships with others and no existence beyond the golf course. Sure, you have the role of a golfer, but you're just swinging clubs, not playing the role. Even big recent games like StarCraft II don't allow you to interact in a way of your choosing. You get lots of cut-scenes, sure, but they're entirely scripted. You can pick what research you want, but it doesn't affect your ""role"" at all. Compare this to a true RPG where you are immersed in the game and its associated story, and you can influence that story through your choices and your interactions with others. You have the ability to select how you want to approach various situations and not everything is scripted. You can be the evil guy out to slay every husband and boink every female you come across, or the good guy paladin type who does his best to support those around you. By selecting a role and then playing the game in a way that's compatible with it, you can make choices that directly affect how others perceive you. In a true RPG, the role you select for yourself matters.','I think the core thing that defines an RPG is character progression. It's the main thing that RPGs have in common, and games of other genres with features like that are often described as having RPG elements. It is quite far removed from the literal meaning of ""Role Playing Game,"" but it makes sense if you trace its lineage. It comes from Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop games. They had a large element of playing a role and making up a story as you go along. But they also had the idea of your character having stats that would improve as you play, either through the use of spells and items or tracking experience points. These stats are used to determine what happens in various situations you encounter in the game (usually combat, but sometimes other things), together with the random factor of a dice roll. Video game RPGs follow this concept. Some RPGs don't have that much of the story creating aspect (e.g. the Final Fantasy games where you have little ability to affect the story), but do have the stat building aspect, and the ability for the player to influence those stats.",1,eli5_human

"Although this movie was not intended to be humorous, it still managed to make me chuckle. Although it wasn't intended to be sorrowful, some of the vignettes made me feel emotionally burdened. Although it is not categorized as an action adventure, it managed to quicken my heartbeat several times. This film, much like real life, does not try to control your emotions or dictate how you should feel. ""The Tapestry of Life"" is a masterfully crafted story that delves into the daily experiences of several individuals as they maneuver through the intricacies of relationships, grief, and self-improvement. The realistic and sincere depictions of these people are sure to keep the audience fully engaged and emotionally invested in their experiences. The remarkable element in this movie is the excellently crafted conversation, highlighting instances of cleverness, openness, and emotions that the audience can easily relate to. It is almost impossible to not feel empathy towards the characters due to their rich traits, including their flaws. The pacing is perfectly balanced, offering a satisfying mix of contemplative moments, anxiety-inducing scenes, and unforeseen turns. The movie's cinematography is a valuable aspect, proficiently using the potential of visual narrative. The employment of both light and color serves to enhance the prevailing atmosphere and is fundamental in depicting the emotional state of the characters. Furthermore, the group of actors gives flawless and outstanding portrayals. The strong connection between them is apparent in their performance, enabling the audience to engage with their narratives and immerse themselves in the richly depicted setting. To sum up, ""The Tapestry of Life"" presents a meaningful and touching examination of the human experience within our interdependent society.

"Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, including Poland. Article 23 called for the restoration of German colonies in the League of Nations mandate system. A 1919 treaty between Germany and the Allies provided for Germany's withdrawal from Poland. The Allied Supreme Council's Draft Treaty of Peace, Article 11, called for the establishment of a 'Commission to prepare a scheme of local autonomy for the territory of Poland, which should include, among other provisions, the right of local self-government, which should be carried out by Polish committees'.

"Nina was at her aunt's house. Her aunt was letting her play with her old porcelain dolls. She was brushing the doll's hair when her head came off. Nina went to look for it and saw that she had fallen down on top of an old carpeted floor, without any apparent damage in sight. At first, she would not believe what she saw but could see no other way out because there were secured into place all kinds of safety devices: The girl looked up from beneath her fingertips as if acknowledging something inside herself; perhaps realizing now how much more important life is than death or how far we can get away from our roots through fateful accidents like this one. I, too, have been reading about these stories lately...and I can't help feeling sorry for my friend who lost her sister last week... I'm glad you liked the story! This theme has become very popular among writers recently - it's hard to believe we've never read anything by another author before! A couple years ago, two friends passed their timeshare home on Long Island. (It wasn't sold until after they died.) Their children are still renters today so they're inheriting some additional money (the mortgage). They've made plans to make improvements to their home because they'll be selling the property eventually. One afternoon, while on vacation here in Florida, I took them around town looking at things they'd enjoy doing once they move back home. It turns out there's nothing they love to do near where they've lived most of their lives. Sounds weird? Maybe. But that's just me. When someone passes, we'll always remember those memories. We may forget details such as: what time he got sick, or his exact weight, etc., but the person will remain part of us forever. The children mentioned above seem to realize that having a family heirloom helps protect against bad luck even though they don't know exactly what's going on behind closed doors regarding Shelley and Godfrey. How many people really understand? We both left our homes soon after graduation and moved to Texas. After living together for six months we bought separate apartments and continued dating. While we were young and broke it didn't feel right knowing we weren't together permanently. He would say lots of nice things about me telling him I'd marry Somebody Likes Me but every time that happened later word spread fast enough that everyone knew anyway. Eventually finalized an agreement for formal marriage via court paperwork then divorced within 3 weeks since I felt it wasn't working out between us. Shortly afterward started seeing a guy I met online again, also moving to TX. Started talking frequently over email. Once I found out he wanted kids immediately told him he's crazy trying to use me and motherhood as leverage. I thought it might take time getting used to being single again but quickly realized he'd already set himself up well financially. His mom owns several properties including rental units which makes him wealthy. Both parents worked outside-the-home jobs early on. Dad even wrote stock options checks monthly to get Mom psychologically ok with leaving work early. Sadly I've come to accept him becoming richer and happier as long as he doesn't try using me to look good to others rather than deal with reality. Years ago we did some traveling during college and spent a month in Vietnam. On day 6 of the trip Mr. caught a quick bug and decided to step aside from being super alert for a bit until morning.

"In the magical world, the Frat houses were revered as institutions where young wizards came to hone their craft and make lifelong connections. They were also known for their daunting thresholds and complex initiation rites. Among them, the Silver Arrow Fraternity stood out as the most exclusive, sought-after, and powerful. For years, the Silver Arrow Fraternity enjoyed supreme dominance over their rival fraternity, the Order of the Crimson Moon. But it all changed when a new batch of freshmen entered the fray. These freshmen were unlike any other, for they possessed a rare magical gift that no one had seen for centuries - the power to control time. As soon as they arrived, the freshmen began causing chaos around campus. They would alter the timelines, prank other students and professors, and make things disappear and reappear at will. Everyone knew it was them, but no one could prove it. The Silver Arrow Fraternity saw this as a threat to their authority and immediately declared war on the newcomers. But the freshmen were not intimidated; they saw this as an opportunity to prove their worth. The war started with petty pranks, such as turning the Silver Arrow's common room into a giant ball pit filled with sticky candy floss or tying their broomsticks together. The Silver Arrow Fraternity responded in kind, but with more sinister intentions. They began kidnapping the freshmen one by one, and then started summoning dark creatures to terrorize them. The freshmen fought back with all their might. They used their control over time to anticipate the attacks and to reinforce their defenses. The war escalated quickly, forcing the faculty to step in and call for peace. But both Fraternities refused to back down. They had tasted blood, and they were not about to let go. It was now a full-blown war, with no end in sight. The tale of the magical war between the Silver Arrow Fraternity and the Order of the Crimson Moon spread like wildfire among students, and even became a subject of inquiry for the ministry of magic. The freshmen with time-bending powers now stood at the forefront of the battle, leading their fraternity. They would either vanquish or perish, but they were determined to be forever remembered as the ones who refused to bow down to their elders' tyranny, and proved their worth as powerful wizards.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo
"In this paper, we provide details of a robotic system that can automate the task of picking and stowing objects from and to a rack in an e-commerce fulfillment warehouse. As part of an NSF-funded robotics grant, we designed, constructed, and deployed a picking system that automates the task of picking and stowing objects from and to a rack in a USPS-approved e-commerce fulfillment warehouse. The system is composed of a floor mounted robot (four-wheel drive) with two picking heads mounted on the front, a network of tracked conveyors, and a shipping conveyor that is mounted above the rack system. The robot is autonomous and has the ability to navigate and map the picking environment. After a customer places an order, the system scans the barcodes on the products being shipped. This information is sent to the inventory management system that identifies the location of the items. The robot picks the items from the rack, places them on the conveyor, and delivers them to the shipping conveyor. Each robot can pick up to 400 items per hour. In a collaborative effort with the USPS and the United Parcel Service (UPS), the University of New Hampshire has built a robotic system that can automate the task of picking and stowing objects from and to a rack in an e-commerce fulfillment warehouse. The system is composed of a floor mounted robot (four-wheel drive) with two picking heads mounted on the front, a network of tracked conveyors, and a shipping conveyor that is mounted above the rack system. The robot is autonomous and has the ability to navigate and map the picking environment. Figure 1 shows a bird's-eye view of the racking system used for the picking system. The conveyor system is divided into two sections, one for shipping and one for receiving. The shipping conveyor is equipped with a robotic arm that moves the package to the package pick-up location, which is equipped with a robotic arm that retrieves the package and places it on the conveyor. The receiving conveyor is equipped with a robotic arm that moves packages to the package delivery location, which is equipped with a robotic arm that retrieves the packages and places them on the conveyor. The rack is equipped with a laser scanner that measures the height of the products in the rack to assist with robotic picking. After a customer places an order, the system scans the barcodes on the products being shipped. This information is sent to the inventory management system that identifies the location of the items. The robot picks the items from the rack, places them on the conveyor, and delivers them to the shipping conveyor. Each robot can pick up to 400 items per hour.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_7B

"Thousands more had official guest status and got a slightly closer view from inside the spaceport itself. A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the 2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station. There will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday's lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch. For those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel. AMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive. It has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos. AMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe. Critical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from. The UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn't engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet. Scientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel. It was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can. This was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn't been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle. But to cut a long story short, the British magnet's super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device. And when the space station's life was extended last year to 2020, the AMS project leaders took the decision to remove the UK magnet and replace it with a less powerful, but much longer-lived, Chinese one. Now, as I say, this is a story with some interesting outcomes. The British magnet is currently sitting in store at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) where AMS was assembled and tested, and there's a lot of interest in seeing its technology put to other uses. The first of these is astronaut protection. The cosmic rays that AMS is trying to characterise are particles that also represent a hazard to humans in space. When astronauts eventually go beyond the space station - back to the Moon, and on to asteroids and Mars - they will need to shield themselves from these high-energy particles. The idea of using a powerful magnetic field to do this job is being investigated Dr Roberto Battiston, the deputy principal investigator on AMS. He told me: ""We continue to work to understand how this technology could be used for future shielding of astronauts undergoing long exposure, for instance at a Moonbase or on a trip to Mars... because this is by far the most advanced super-conducting magnet-design ever built and completed for a space mission. It is not going to fly but it had everything that would allow it to fly. ""The European Space Agency asked me to submit a proposal for a feasibility study and [Scientific Magnetics] is part of it. ""We would design the magnet in a different way to the AMS one. AMS was designed to have a very strong magnetic field within an inner bore. By modifying the coils and the currents, we can design a magnetic field confined in an external ring surrounding an inner bore that is magnetic-field free. In this internal module will be the habitable part for the astronauts - where they will live. We are talking about something having a diameter of about five to six metres and the length of 10m - surrounded by this magnetic field that is intense enough to bend away cosmic rays coming from deep space."" There are immense practicalities to overcome, of course. These special magnets get their strength because they are superconducting. This means running them at cryo-temperatures, which demands a lot of liquid helium. This has a tendency to boil off over time, limiting the life of your device, which brings us back to AMS. All that said, Professor Battiston is encouraged by the research. He says it should be possible to limit radiation exposure on a Mars flight to something similar to that currently experienced by astronauts on a six-month stay at the space station. The other big space application for which British magnet technology might be useful is in the plasma rockets that could one day propel all spacecraft. These rely on the motion of highly excited gases, or plasmas, moulded by magnetic fields to provide thrust. Although they don't give the initial big kick you get from chemical combustion, their supreme efficiency means they can go on thrusting for extended periods, achieving far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed. Proponents of plasma rockets say they could dramatically cut the journey time to Mars from months to weeks. Scientific Magnetics has already produced a superconducting magnet for a testbed at Ad Astra in Texas, the company at the forefront of this propulsion technology. Steve Harrison from Scientific Magnetics told me: ""These rockets use radio frequency heating to generate the plasma and then the magnets contain the plasma in the same way they do in a tokomak fusion reactor. The magnets are profiled such that they form a sort of nozzle out the back; and because the plasma is expanding and supersonic, it flies out and gives you thrust. For the system Ad Astra has been testing for the last two years, we designed and built the super-conducting magnet."" Similar obstacles to the magnetic shield prevent immediate adoption of the propulsion application as well, especially if the propulsion magnets incorporate cryogenic liquids, but both concepts are definitely worth watching for the future.",1,xsum_human

"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, there are several reasons why hardcore punk music is actually far from boring. First, one of the defining characteristics of punk music is its raw and energetic sound, which often includes fast-paced guitar riffs and aggressive drumming that can be incredibly invigorating to listen to. Additionally, the themes explored in many hardcore punk songs, such as social and political injustice, personal struggles, and rebellion against authority, can be deeply relatable and impactful to listeners. Finally, the DIY ethos and community-driven nature of punk culture can provide a sense of belonging and purpose to those who participate in it. Therefore, it is important to recognize that while hardcore punk may not be to everyone's taste, it can still hold significant value and meaning for those who enjoy it.",0,cmv_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo
"Caroline Wootton-Thomas, 49, forged colleague's signatures on cheques and transferred cash to a bank account she set up in her mother's name. She used the council's Child Protection Unit petty cash fund for debts, expensive gifts and luxury holidays. A Cardiff Crown Court jury convicted Wootton-Thomas, of Newport, of theft and transferring criminal property. The court heard she had asked to be put in charge of the petty cash fund which was meant to be used to cover fuel and parking costs. The grandmother was caught after a bank statement was sent to the wrong department. She denied any wrongdoing and blamed her colleagues for stealing the money, which the jury rejected. Matthew Roberts, prosecuting, said Wootton-Thomas had shown an ""arrogance"" which culminated in her mother also being charged with money laundering, though she was cleared at trial.

"Megan Huntsman, 40, was arrested a year ago after the bodies were found in cardboard boxes in the garage of her former house. In February she pleaded guilty to six counts of murder. A judge in the city of Provo gave her the maximum sentence of at least 30 years and up to life in prison. Police said that the babies were born between 1996 and 2006 and were suffocated or strangled by Huntsman immediately after birth. They said she put the bodies in plastic bags and packed them in boxes in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, about 45 miles (75km) south of Salt Lake City. She left the boxes behind when she moved out of the house and they were found by her estranged husband, Darren West, last April. A seventh baby also found there was believed to be stillborn. Police said Huntsman had been a heavy methamphetamine user and ""didn't want the babies."" In court papers she said she wanted to take responsibility for the deaths. Officials said Mr West was the father of the babies but he was not a suspect in the case. He and Huntsman have three other children together. In April 2014 he had just been released after serving eight years in prison for drug crimes and was retrieving some of his belongings from the house when he made the gruesome discovery. A final decision on how long Huntsman will spend behind bars will be made by a parole board. Prosecutors said that she was likely to spend the rest of her life in prison.",1,xsum_human

"The tense and current political thriller is directly targeting the contentious US policy of rendition, which is simply another unsettling phrase reminiscent of George Orwell's work, such as ""collateral damage."" Perpetrating illegal interrogation without following the proper legal procedures, including torture, on suspects believed to be terrorists. The movie's two main plot-lines are intertwined as the Egyptian Chief of Police oversees an inhuman interrogation while also being targeted by a fundamentalist suicide-bomb plot. The bombing set-piece graphic is excellent and chillingly realistic, and its conclusion is revealed in a fashionable Tarantino-esque flashback. Similarly, the torture scenes of an innocent man are also portrayed without flinching and with all their gory details. The film highlights the effectiveness of using torture as a means of gathering intelligence in the fight against terrorists. It also portrays the idea of unaccountable bureaucracy causing harm to innocent individuals, symbolized by Meryl Streep's character as the unfeeling boss who orders rendition without a second thought. Instead of focusing on Kafka's stories, consider the more recent tragic incident of the innocent Brazilian being killed in London in 2005. Despite this, the head of the Metropolitan police remains in his position and no one has been held accountable for the murder. Throughout the movie, the unfamiliar actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas realistically and significantly portrayed the two pivotal roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber, resulting in excellent acting. Yigal Naor's portrayal of the intimidating Chief of Police and Zineb Ouhach's performance as his idealistic lovelorn daughter are convincing, and their lack of familiarity with the audience enhances their characters' authenticity. Among the major Hollywood personalities in attendance, Gyllenhaal's reputation escalates with each subsequent film, as he portrays a Government official who initially seems uninvolved but becomes tormented and remorseful and ultimately does the correct thing. Witherspoon's role as a distressed wife is primarily played in a singular tone, but is still portrayed convincingly. Meanwhile, David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin effectively depict self-interested senators and their followers who will only offer limited assistance until their own professional opportunities are put at risk. The plot has a couple of drawbacks including the lack of necessity for building up the suspense around El-Ibrahimi's escape and the character played by Streep being too predictable as the villain. The most disappointing aspect is the senseless portrayal of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend who appears to be there solely for decorative purposes and a short unnecessary romantic encounter. Overall, it is an absorbing and intellectually stimulating movie experience.",0,imdb_human_para

"We learned long ago. Humanities greatest threat has never been from the stars, or each other. Our greatest threat has been with us all along. Children, gone missing, presumed kidnapped. Elderly, missing, presumed to have wandered off and forgotten everything, fallen into a ditch and died. Adults, missing, presumed to have drank too much, went home with the wrong stranger. We thought them all unsolved cases. When we finally solved them, the world became truly frightened. You see, even in the middle of nowhere, there is noise. Crickets, birds, bats. Everywhere you go there is always a noise. So what happens when there is none? When all sound ceases? Our first scientists tested the theory out in soundproof rooms. There was no reaction. We didn't account for the lights. So we turned them off. No recorders, no lights, nothing. We assume we never heard their screams. There was nothing in the room when we opened it. However;. Soon eyewitness reports came in. A young couple were out in their car one night on a dirt road. They stood under a clouded sky.

"Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting decor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans. When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50 miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a secret menu for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor (not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams (plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance. If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is. There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan. Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

"In the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor Haile Selassie sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. He laid claim to both territories in a letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Paris Peace Conference and at the First Session of the United Nations. In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued. The British and Americans preferred to cede all of Eritrea except the Western province to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during World War II. The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the UN General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.",1,squad_human
"The legend blames some evil wizard for the fall of humanity. Isn't that always the way? It's the witch, it's the wizard, it's the devil. It's never God, is it? No, it's not always the way. The fall of humanity in many legends and mythologies is attributed to various sources, including mankind's own hubris or ignorance, divine punishment, or a combination of both. For example, in Greek mythology, the fall of humanity was caused by Pandora opening the forbidden box she had been warned not to open. In Norse mythology, the fall of humanity was caused by the gods' displeasure at the actions of the Aesir. In some versions of Christian mythology, the fall of humanity was caused by Adam and Eve's disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.",0,wp_machine_continuation_text-davinci-003

"Hanna's crystal clear voice pierced the stillness of the church. The congregation sat in stunned awe at the sheer beauty of it. Hanna was so pleased all her hard work over four years had paid off and now she could finally hear herself sing for God with a pure heart, no longer disturbed by the thought that she wasn't good enough to do this work. It felt really strange as soon as they started singing 'I Surrender All'. For the first time ever, Didi felt like there were other people in the room somewhere besides just Hannah. This is what it feels like! Another world opened up inside me, another dimension where I feel connected somehow...

"Well, first off, a lot of them do succeed in the NFL. It's just more interesting when a really good college player turns out to be a bust, so people talk about it more. Also, you can't compare the NFL and the WNBA. The WNBA doesn't have the depth. The reason you have a lot of great college players turning into busts is because of the lack of depth. If every player in the WNBA was as good as the best college players, I bet you that 90 of the college players would become successful in the WNBA. I think that a large part of the reason why there are so many busts is because of the coaching. If the WNBA had good coaches, and they were able to develop the players instead of just giving them the keys to the car and seeing what they can do, then I think you'd see a lot more good players in the WNBA. BTW, I don't think that the fact that they are women has anything to do with it. It's just the way the WNBA is run. By the way, I'm a huge WNBA fan. I think that the league is a lot of fun to watch. I'm glad that you like it as well. Here's the thing. In the WNBA, it's not just about the women. It's about the coaching, and the fact that teams are in different cities and don't have as much time to play together, or to practice together. The reason why the WNBA doesn't have the depth of the NBA is because the WNBA doesn't have the depth. It's the same reason why the WNBA doesn't have the depth of the NBA. The WNBA doesn't have the depth. Yes, there are more women than men, and the WNBA has more women than the NBA, but it's not just about the gender. It's about the fact that the WNBA doesn't have the depth of the NBA. Well, I don't have a problem with the fact that there are women in the WNBA. I think that it's a good thing, and I'm glad that they have a league. I just think that the WNBA needs to change some of their policies and rules to make it a better league. Well, I don't think it's a good thing. I just think it's a business. And when I say I don't think it's a good thing, I mean that it's not an ideal situation. It's not like I'm saying it's not worth watching or something like that. What does ""not ideal"" mean? What I mean by ""not ideal"" is that the WNBA would be a much better league if it had more depth. The WNBA is a poorly run league, and that's why it's not as good as it could be. I think that the WNBA should have more teams, and they should have more player. Sorry, but it is about the gender. It's just the fact that you don't know anything about the WNBA. I've been watching the WNBA since it started, and I've been a big fan of it ever since. The WNBA isn't run badly. They can't add more teams because of the economy, and if they add more teams, then you'll have more teams that will lose money. You can't have a league that can't stay afloat. It's not a good idea to have a league where everyone loses money, and you have to cut your losses. I'm not trying to say that you're wrong, and I'm not trying to be mean. But I think that you're wrong about the WNBA, and it's just because you don't know enough about it. I'm not saying that the WNBA doesn't have a problem with depth. I'm just saying that there's a reason why they don't have as much depth as the NBA, and the main reason is that the WNBA doesn't have as many teams as the NBA, and it's not a good idea to have a league where you have more teams that lose money than teams that make money. You're just completely wrong about what you're saying. They tried to have more teams, but they had to cut some teams because of the economy. They tried to have more teams, but the players didn't want to play in the other cities, so they cut the teams that didn't",0,eli5_machine_continuation_7B
"By law, he must stand down as president in 2013, having completed two consecutive terms as president of the former Soviet republic. However, his years in office have marked Georgia for years to come. To some he will always be the hero of the Rose Revolution, sweeping away Soviet-style corruption and courting the West. To others, he is the leader who rashly sparked a dangerous war with Russia. Mr Saakashvili's background has all the ingredients of a successful career on the international stage and helps explain his appeal to Brussels and Washington. Born in 1967 in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to a doctor father and a historian mother, he did his Soviet military service in Ukraine, where he went on to study international law. Receiving a fellowship from the US state department, he attended Columbia University law school and was hired by a New York-based law firm. In addition to his native Georgian, he speaks English, French, Ukrainian and Russian. He and his Dutch wife, human rights specialist Sandra Elisabeth Roelofs, have two sons. Returning to Georgia from his career abroad, he was appointed justice minister in October 2000 by the then President, Eduard Shevardnadze. But he resigned the following year, saying he considered it immoral to remain a member of a government plagued by corruption and cronyism. After forming an opposition party, the National Movement, he was elected head of Tbilisi city council where he built up a power base. Discontent with Mr Shevardnadze grew steadily and when parliamentary elections in November 2003 were tainted by allegations of fraud, Mr Saakashvili organised daily protests. The Rose Revolution culminated in the bloodless storming of the Georgian parliament and Mr Shevardnadze's resignation. In January 2004, Mr Saakashvili was elected president of his country with 96 of the vote, at the tender age of 37. ""I'm not pro-American or pro-Russian - I am pro-Georgian,"" the new president said in his inaugural speech. However, it rapidly became clear that he meant to take Georgia out of Moscow's orbit, by joining Nato no less. Relations between Georgia and its giant neighbour rapidly deteriorated, as Tbilisi pressed for the return of its breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had allied themselves with Russia. Meanwhile, President Saakashvili cemented his reputation as a Western ally by committing Georgian troops to the Nato-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Ill-feeling between Tbilisi and Moscow erupted into open war in August 2008, after Georgia made a lightning military assault on South Ossetia, where Russia kept a peacekeeping force. Russian troops struck back rapidly, driving out President Saakashvili's soldiers and pushing into Georgia. While they stopped short of a full invasion and eventually withdrew back into South Ossetia, the Russians had humiliated the Georgian leader. Not only did Georgia's chances of regaining its territories look even more remote but its Nato ambitions were badly damaged, since a condition for membership of the alliance is the absence of territorial disputes. Mr Saakashvili had already been re-elected as president before the war, although his share of the vote in January 2008 was sharply down, at 53. Internal political opposition to his rule has grown - a development that might be welcomed as a sign that a healthy democracy is taking root in Georgia. However, Mr Saakashvili's opponents accuse him of exhibiting the very authoritarianism of which he has accused Kremlin leaders. During huge street protests against alleged political corruption in 2007, his government used police to disperse demonstrators and declared a temporary state of emergency. Protests demanding the president's resignation ended in bloodshed in 2011, and 2012 saw mass rallies in Tbilisi in protest at prison abuse, prompting Mr Saakashvili's interior minister to resign. The prison scandal was a particularly sensitive issue for the president as he has made much of his law and order policies, eradicating much of the corruption that used to mar everyday life. Critics also accuse Mr Saakashvili, the economic liberal, of having failed to tackle poverty. Although per capita GDP has nearly doubled since he took power it remains a fraction of that of Russia or Estonia. Under his rule, Georgia's external debt has grown while direct foreign investment has been uneven, a recent report by the Carnegie Endowment found. In his defence, Mikheil Saakashvili took power at a time when Georgia looked like becoming a failed state. Perhaps the biggest test of his credentials as a statesman will be how he handles the transition to his successor as president.",1,xsum_human

"Once upon a time, in a world full of immortal beings, death was a foreign concept. Until now. It started out as a normal day, with the sun shining and birds chirping. But then it happened- one of the beloved denizens of the world had suddenly passed away. Nobody could believe it; it didn't seem real. The shock of witnessing death for the first time sent waves of disbelief through the community. As news spread of the death, people began to panic. How could this be possible? What did it mean for their lives? Was this a sign that the end of their world was near? Questions swirled in their minds as they tried to make sense of what had occurred. The leaders of the community quickly convened to discuss what to do next. They knew that something like this had never happened before, and feared the consequences of such an event. They declared that no further deaths would ever be tolerated, and issued new laws to ensure that immortality was maintained. In the aftermath of the tragedy, life slowly returned to normal. People reflected on the significance of the event, and many developed a newfound appreciation for life. They vowed to cherish every moment, as once again, death seemed like an impossibility. For generations, people talked about the day that death came to the world of the immortals. It was a day of mourning, but also a day of reflection and understanding.

"The Wide Leg Trouser is a new trend that we are just beginning to comprehend. The wide leg trouser is leading SS15 trends, whether it is in denim, cropped, printed or striped styles. The appeal of a wide leg trouser lies in its effortless quality. If you're getting exhausted by the skinny jean trend and seeking to experiment with a different style, this may be the solution for you. According to Louise Redknapp, opting for wide-leg trousers can provide a refreshing change from wearing skinny jeans. For a considerable amount of time, skinny jeans have been dominant, but despite being timeless, wide-legged pants will offer you a different style option. This appearance has been revived many times since the 1970s. Seven years ago, Lou experimented with a Stella McCartney flared jean and fortunately, she managed to retain them. If you are not very tall, the wide leg can be scary or daunting. The shoe is the crucial element. It can be challenging to look good in a large quantity of fabric, but by wearing high heels and keeping the upper half of your outfit simple, you can achieve a confident and flattering look. If you wear cropped voluminous trousers, it is necessary to elongate your leg, which can be achieved by wearing high heeled shoes with an exposed top of the foot. Louise and Emma suggest wearing high heeled shoes to prevent drowning in excessive fabric. To ensure that the outfit looks balanced, Louise suggests combining a basic knit top with wide-legged pants. To create the illusion of longer legs, opt for high-waisted bottoms and choose a very long length. The key is to maintain the current and cool appearance without making it too costume-like by pairing a basic knit, shirt, or tee with the appropriate proportions. Gucci's collection featured flared jeans in vintage washes, making denim the most effortless way to follow the trend. According to the fashionable duo, denim is the most effortless means of embracing the style. The fashion trend of wide-leg trousers was featured on multiple runways, such as Gucci's SS15 show which presented a denim version of the trend. Topshop offers their own version of the trend with the Miller jean. Celine also displayed colourful and flowing wide-leg bottoms in their SS15 collection. Meanwhile, Topshop has promptly imitated this by introducing their own version called the Miller, which features a wide-legged flare style that reflects the fashion of the 1970s. Celine and Stella McCartney maintained a sophisticated appearance by wearing pants with a more formal design, ideal for a nighttime outfit. Consider experimenting with Finery London's online label if you're looking for a comparable fashion style at a more affordable price. One trend for this season is the wide, flowing silhouette of pants, which can easily refresh any wardrobe. The added benefit is that this trend can be worn even when the weather isn't favorable.

"We analyze the security of the authentication code against pollution attacks in network coding given by Oggier and Fathi and show one way to remove one very strong condition they have. To resolve this problem, we also use a few different methods to create a new scheduled access point that can be as easily accessed as possible: 1) A new key password for the remote client: 2) The same key for the selected remote service provider's browser: 3) The exact key used by each client-server connection (or client-client interface) using its own protocol. For example, if you want to check whether or not your server is licensed with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), then use whitelist.conf instead of TLS 1.0.5.0. If you are running an Open Source software program like Gmail, then use TLS 1.0.8. In addition, in the case of HIPAA compliant systems such as Exchange Server 2000, because there are so many health concerns associated with SMB networks, it is important that security measures are taken to prevent these problems from happening again. Once the authorization certificate has been authenticated, the security credentials will be stored and transmitted over HTTP. To receive all health codes derived from CRM, it must reload the page-to-page, via HTTPS. This mechanism allows us to load health codes into our clients' browsers while still enabling privacy protection. In some cases, the client will automatically add at least two-thirds of the health codes generated in the first instance, leading to all the health codes being accessible only when needed. Because SOAPDHCP can guarantee confidentiality between users, it's necessary to encrypt any health codes generated without permission. However, there is no guarantee that EVERY health code may be available based on the originator of the health code. Humans need different protocols to understand the origin of the health codes, so different people should assume that their health codes are authentic. If I call my server to obtain the full health codes generated by CRM, can health codes loaded into their clients' browsers actually be obtained? Of course! Depending on how your company operates, health codes could be generated before the user even reaches his or her endpoint. One method that may work is by either accessing the user account directly or through the cloud program. To get more information about how health codes can be loaded into your client's browser, read the article titled ""Health Code Loader Update."" You can download the module for free here: A single health code generated only after a second visit to the client would produce two health codes. According to the most recent health code delta estimates on the official database for CRM, for every three hours, the total number of health codes generated was 33 times greater than the average life span for all healthcare providers in the United States. This means that each time a health code generated until 24 hours later was used by 139,000 patients per year, accounting for 81 percent of all patient visits, it would take three days for them to arrive at the client's server. That means that the health codes generated by health servers do not always reflect the actual health data provided to them during their respective visits, but rather, have to be re-created manually. For example, if your company's health system uses a single health code generation method (CGI), health codes rendered before the end of the day are processed by your server, which requires a relatively large amount of processing power. The price tag of CGI is probably much higher since health codes rendered during hard mining sessions cost 800-900, and the client typically gets 600 to 735 worth of data. Moreover, even if your health system is optimized according to CGI recommendations, it still needs to ensure that health codes generated before the end of the day are sent back and processed correctly.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_125m
"I shouldn't be here right now. There is no reason I should be alive. At this point, it can't be a coincidence anymore. My first attempt was back when I was fifteen. I'd been planning it for a few weeks, so I knew what I was doing. I just didn't think it would fail so miserably. I guess I wasn't ready to die, or maybe my body was. I don't know. But I do know that when I woke up in the hospital, I was surprised to find myself still alive. I've always been the type of person who thinks everything is going to go wrong. I'm the kind of person that tries to prepare for the worst, so I'm not caught off guard when it comes. When I was a little girl, I had a bad habit of chewing on my lips. It was so bad that my mom would have to take my toys away and hide them. She thought it was just a phase I was going through. I was an early bloomer, but I was going through puberty, so she just assumed it was the beginning of my ""crazy"" days. But I knew the truth. I was doing it on purpose. I'd look in the mirror and see the bleeding and the cuts. I was doing it on purpose. I thought it would get her to leave me alone. I thought I could make my parents hate me. I knew it was a sick thought. I didn't know why I was doing it. I was just trying to get her to leave me alone. I'd try to talk to her, but she would just pretend not to hear me. I felt like it was the only way to get her to pay attention to me. I remember the day I finally did it. I was sitting in my room, crying. I was trying to convince her that something was wrong with me, but she wouldn't listen. I was so angry. I got up from the bed and walked over to the bathroom. I grabbed the razor from the counter, and walked back to my bed. I sat down on the bed, and I looked at the blade. I didn't think about what I was doing, I just did it. I cut my wrists as hard as I could. I tried to make sure I didn't miss. I just wanted it to be over. I wanted her to notice. I wanted her to see that I was hurting. But she didn't. She didn't even notice. I was shocked. I didn't even realize that I had cut that deep. I didn't know I had cut myself so bad. I felt the blood run down my arms, and I felt the life run out of me. I thought I was dead. I thought I had failed. I laid there on the floor, crying and screaming. I screamed so loud that my mom heard me. She came running in, and she saw me lying on the floor, holding my arms tightly. I was crying and screaming. I saw the blood. I saw that I had actually done it this time. I had almost succeeded. She called 911, and they came. They put me on a stretcher, and I heard my mom crying. I heard her screaming. I heard her yelling at me to stay with her. I was so weak. I couldn't hold on. I felt myself slipping away. I could feel myself dying. I could feel my heart beating slower and slower. I knew I was dying. I could hear the paramedics yelling. I could hear my mom crying. I could feel myself slipping away. I woke up in a hospital, and I saw my mom sitting next to me. She was crying, and I was crying. I didn't know why I was crying. I had failed again. I had let them down. I was alone. I had been all alone. I couldn't do it. I couldn't kill myself. I was weak. I was pathetic. I woke up in a hospital again, and again, I was crying. This time I didn't know why. I was staring up at the ceiling, and I didn't know where I was. I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what. I felt someone take my hand, and I turned my head. I saw my mom standing there. She was crying, and she was holding my hand. I looked at her, and I tried to say something. I tried to say that I was sorry. I tried to say that I loved her.

"Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia.

"New York: An underground electrical fire caused a huge explosion in downtown Buffalo, sending a manhole cover flying more than 200 feet into the air on Sunday morning. The blast took place on Tupper Street around 11:30 a.m. and resulted in the evacuation of two buildings in the area. Authorities were quick to arrive on the scene and have since contained the fire. According to the Buffalo police department, smoke was emanating from the manholes, causing initial panic among the residents. At the time of the explosion, a photojournalist was interviewing a man on the street, with a second blast taking place about half a block behind them. Miraculously, the manhole cover flew up without causing any reported injuries or fatalities. The immediate priority for the city officials was to ensure the safety of the residents. As a precautionary measure, two buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and fire crews worked swiftly to contain the situation. ""We came as quickly as possible to make sure everyone was safe,"" said a spokesperson for the authorities. ""Our focus now is to mitigate the scene and prevent any further incidents."" The initial investigation suggests that the explosion was due to an underground electrical fire. However, the exact cause leading to the explosion remains unclear, and authorities are working diligently to determine whether any lapse in safety measures occurred. The Department of Public Works is responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of underground electrical infrastructure in Buffalo. With an incident of such magnitude, city officials are expected to take immediate corrective measures to ensure better safety of the residents against any similar incidents in the future. ""Anytime something like this happens, it's our responsibility to review the safety protocols and determine what happened,"" said a city official. ""We will be working closely with the authorities and local residents to evaluate this situation and take appropriate action.""

"Sally took out a bag of chips. She was chewing loudly in class. Benny couldn't stand the noise that she was making. After a few minutes, he snatched the bag of chips from her hand and threw it across the room. ""Stop making so much noise!"" Benny shouted. ""You're a jerk!"" Sally shouted back. ""You're a jerk, too!"" Benny shouted back. ""I'm going to tell the teacher."" Sally stormed out of the classroom. ""You're a jerk,"" Benny said to himself. He was really upset about what he had done. Benny's teacher saw the bag of chips. ""Benny, why didn't you throw this away?"" ""I'm sorry. I had too much anger. I lost control,"" Benny said. ""That's okay,"" Mrs. Sonnenblick said. ""But you must learn how to control your anger. If you get angry, you can calm yourself by doing some deep breathing. Take a few deep breaths. Your body will automatically slow down. It's okay to be angry, but you don't want to stay angry for a long time."" Benny practiced some deep breathing. He did it for a minute. He felt more relaxed. ""Thank you, Mrs. Sonnenblick,"" Benny said. ""You're welcome, Benny."" Mrs. Sonnenblick said. When Benny went home, he told his mom about what happened. ""I'm so sorry, Benny,"" his mom said. ""I know it wasn't your fault. Sally is a very angry person. She should go to see a doctor."" Benny's mom and dad had a long talk with Benny. They explained that anger is a normal emotion. But we must learn how to control it. If you're angry, you need to think about what you are feeling and why. You need to think about what happened before you got angry. You also need to think about what you can do to make it better. After the talk, Benny wrote a letter to Sally. He said he was sorry about what happened. He said he would never throw anything at her again. Then he went outside and played ball with his friends. Benny's mom and dad also talked to Sally's parents. They explained what Benny had done. They explained that Benny was very sorry about what happened. Sally's mom was very upset about what Benny had done. But Sally's dad said, ""This is a good opportunity to teach Sally how to control her anger."" Sally's parents and Benny's parents talked about what to do next. Sally's mom said Benny should go to Sally's house and say he is sorry. They decided to meet in the park at noon. On Saturday, Sally's parents and Benny's parents met in the park. They talked about what happened. Then Benny's parents said, ""We hope Sally's parents can visit our home soon. We would like to have dinner with them."" ""I'm sure Sally would like that, too,"" Sally's dad said. After the meeting, Sally's parents and Benny's parents went to lunch. Then Benny's mom and Sally's mom went shopping. They bought clothes for Sally and Benny. Later, Benny's mom and Sally's mom talked about their children. They both said they are very happy that their children have become friends. At noon, Sally and Benny met at the park. Benny brought a bag of chips. He put the bag down on the ground. ""It's a nice day,"" Benny said. ""Yes,"" Sally said. ""I'm glad we decided to meet here. I like to come to this park."" ""I do, too,"" Benny said. ""I'm really glad we can be friends,"" Sally said. ""Yes, it's great,"" Benny said. ""Benny, do you want to play baseball with me?"" Sally asked. ""That would be fun,"" Benny said. Sally and Benny played baseball together. They had fun. After a few minutes, Sally and Benny went home. They were happy that they had become friends.

Professionals assumed the duty of informing decision makers and the public about the matter, adjusting national protocols to address the concerns of the general population, and training numerous medical teams across the country.

"Baroness Newlove said 15 of victims had been given the opportunity to make a victim statement in 201516. She said there had been little change since 2013 - when figures were first complied - and ""more needs to be done."" The Ministry of Justice said it will spend PS70m helping victims this year. As part of an official code of practice, every victim who reports a crime is entitled to write a statement about how the offence has affected their life. If a suspect is convicted in court, a victim statement can be read out before sentencing - as well as later at a parole hearing. However, in a report about the situation in England and Wales, Baroness Newlove said victims given had been given the chance of making statements in only 15 of cases. The right of victims to make a statement should be enshrined in law, the commissioner added, with sanctions for police and other agencies if they did not offer the service. ""Enough is enough,"" said Baroness Newlove, who has campaigned against violence since her husband, Garry, was attacked and killed by youths outside their Warrington home in 2007. ""No-one can claim that victims are'at the heart of the criminal justice system' when these figures suggest that the Victims' Code is no more than a wish list,"" she added. ""More needs to be done to support victims of crime."" She added: ""There are laws in place to protect the rights of offenders - but nothing to protect the rights of victims. Yet again victims' rights are being ignored."" A Ministry of Justice spokesman welcomed the report, saying it would consider its findings carefully. The government has allocated PS67.85m to Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in 201617, and again in 201718, to support victims of crime, the spokesman said. ""It is vital that blameless victims see swift and certain justice, which is why we have protected the victims' budget and given PCCs almost PS70m to support victims in their areas. ""We have long committed to strengthening victims' rights, to ensure the most vulnerable get the support they deserve,"" the spokesman added.",1,xsum_human
"Synergistic interactions are ubiquitous in the real world. Recent studies have revealed that, for a single-layer network, synergy can enhance spreading and even induce an explosive contagion. There is at least one other way synergistically mediated by synergy to increase transmission of diseases, including HIVAIDS epidemic control mechanisms. The cost effective use of synergy may be traced back to the 3 billion program to improve HIV prevention efforts nationwide, according to researchers from PEN America, a nonprofit group dedicated to disseminating science about global advocacy against AIDS. Although The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the program costs 700 million per year - much less than it would pay if implemented globally. This information was recently revealed in the Journal of AIDS Research Treatment Science, which reported on synergism among the seven health organizations working together with the World Health Organization (WHO). ""This synergy between disease surveillance, HIV prevention programs worldwide, and collaborative effects within global cooperation has immense potential,"" said lead author Dr. David Kahn. ""We believe that synergy could change lives as we know them."" Kahn told VOA that synergy encourages science based interventions using different strategies such as collaboration between public health agencies or government institutions focused specifically towards addressing HIV epidemics - both new approaches bringing researchers closer toward achieving results. He added that synergy also opens up the possibility to promote human rights protection policy initiatives across regions around the globe while providing support for international collaborations through peer review and scientific research projects when possible.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_350m
"Part One: Morning His eyes blurred with sleep, Bob aimlessly slapped around his nightstand until he finally landed on the alarm's snooze button for the fifth time that morning. ""Jesus, Bob,"" his wife, Patricia, shouted into the darkness. ""Shut that damn thing off and get up already."" Reluctant but mostly awake, Bob slowly stood, stretched, and glanced at the time: 5:36 A.M. ""Christ!"" he blurted out. ""I'm already thirty minutes behind!"" Bob flicked on the bedroom light, blinding Patricia, as he began rummaging through his side of the closet. ""Pat, do me a solid and make breakfast for me, dear. I have to get in the shower."" ""If you'd got up on time,"" she said calmly as she sat up in bed, ""you could make your own breakfast."" ""Ehh..... I know. I just have to be in early for inventory. I'm just not used to waking up so early."" He continued to sort through his polo shirts and khakis until he finally found a set that appealed to him, then laid the rejects on his bed. ""Oh, don't worry,"" Patricia said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, ""I'll hang those up for you."" ""Thanks, dear,"" he said, oblivious to her tone. Just before exiting the bedroom, he paused in the doorway, then released a tremendous fart. ""Ahh, man!"" he exclaimed as Patricia recoiled from the stench, ""time to cut down on red meat, I guess."" Despite the fact that he was running late, Bob lingered in the shower for nearly half an hour, only emerging when the hot water had run out. He was meticulously combing his hair when Patricia knocked on the door. ""Are you going to be much longer?"" she asked. ""I've been waiting to pee for fifteen minutes and I feel like I'm gon na explode!"" Bob sighed and opened the door. ""I hate when you rush me,"" he said as Patricia raced past him. He shut the door behind him as Patricia surveyed the scene in their small bathroom: toilet seat left up, pajamas in a pile next to the hamper, and a stream of water flowing towards the door that had dripped from the misaligned shower curtain. When Patricia emerged from the bathroom, Bob was already wearing his jacket and packing his briefcase. His breakfast was sitting untouched on the kitchen table. ""Aren't you going to eat?"" she asked. ""Sorry, no time. I'll just pick up something on the way. By the way, I used the last of your shampoo."" He kissed her on the cheek, then quickly groped her breasts through her pajama top. ""Honk honk!"" he cried as he let her go and stepped out the door. It was only a ten-minute walk to the train station, so Bob lit a cigarette as he stood on the platform, prompting a young couple to glare at him and move their infant's stroller out of the cloud of lingering blue smoke. Since he had another twenty minutes or so, he flicked the stub onto the tracks and went to the station's Starbucks. Because it was so early, the line was long, filled with other commuters and tourists heading into Toronto for a day of siteseeing. Bob watched as the line slowly progressed, growing impatient and worrying about the time. ""Is this going to take long??"" he bellowed at no one in particular. ""I have to catch a train!"" Despite the glares from the other customers, Bob simply pulled out his cell phone and began playing Game of War with the volume on full blast. Finally, with about five minutes to spare, only one customer remained before it was Bob's turn. Bob listened as the pretty young woman began ordering. ""Bonjour. Je voudrais une ""Hey!"" Bob shouted at her. ""This is Ontario, not Quebec! English, please!"" She paused, startled by Bob's interruption. After gathering her wits, she flipped him the bird and continued to order in French. Bob turned to the couple behind him. ""Typical rude French. I don't know if they have people like that in China,"" he said to the third-generation Canadians of Korean descent, ""but they're all over the place in Canada."" The young man looked as if he was about to say something, but his girlfriend waved him off, so they settled for flipping him the bird when he wasn't looking, then taking a picture for her Instagram. The pretty young (but rude!) French girl with the nice ass finally took her coffee, so Bob stepped up to the counter and began reading the menu. ""What do I want?"" he asked himself. ""What..... Do..... I..... Want...?"" he asked himself mindlessly. ""What...?"" he asked himself mindlessly as he debated each menu item in his head. Just then his phone rang, serenading the store with PICK UP THE PHONE sang to the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony over and over. ""Hello?"" he asked as the barista strained to keep a retail smile on her face. ""Hi, Bob,"" Patricia said. ""Is this a bad time?"" ""Not at all,"" he replied, holding a finger up to the barista, asking for a moment. Her smile faded slightly. ""WHEN you buy me a new bottle of shampoo,"" she emphasised, ""can you pick up some paprika as well?"" ""I wasn't planning on going to the store today."" ""Too bad, Bob. You know what kind of shampoo I use, right?"" ""Yeah, the dandruff shampoo for thinning hair,"" he announced to everyone around him. Patricia sighed. ""Yes, Bob, that one. See you tonight. Have a good day at work."" Bob turned back to the barista. After another moment of debate, he said, ""gim me a tall caramel macchiato, extra caramel, non-fat milk with an extra shot of espresso and don't foam the milk too much."" The barista nodded, marked the cup, and asked, ""can I get your name please?"" ""Bob: Bee Ohh Bee."" ""Alright, Bob, that'll be 7.17."" Bob let out a low whistle. ""Damn. Let's see if I have enough change."" He began rummaging through the coins in his pocket. ""Two..... Three..... Four...... One, two, three, four quarters is five..... Five-twenty-five....five-fifty...... Nope, guess not,"" he said, handing her his debit card. Bob waited, watching the clock as the baristas made a long procession of drinks before getting around to his. ""You're lucky the train is late,"" he curtly told the young woman as he grabbed it off the counter. In fact, the train was precisely on time when it arrived twelve minutes later; Bob had assumed the trains ran on the hour, and thus would arrive at 20 after like his usual train did. It gave him enough time for a quick cigarette and to finish his coffee, both being discarded on the tracks just as the GO train pulled into the station. Bob took an aisle seat in the family section, laid his briefcase on the seat next to him, then placed his feet on the seat across from him. He then laid back and closed his eyes, and soon was snoring loudly.",1,wp_human

"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. In any case, it is important not only for the benefit of the brave souls who gave up their lives fighting for freedom but also because the ideology of Communism has dominated our society so much during the Cold War era: the anti-communism was created by Hitler as a means of dealing with Stalin's Nazi Germany over which no one had control over the values and beliefs of the Soviet Union itself. The British Empire suffered greatly due to the collapse of communism abroad too. Keep in mind that it is necessary in this period to ensure that Americans continue to learn from history. The threat of socialism explicitly intended to destroy capitalism is real. To see this through remains crucial if we are to preserve Western Civilization after these vices have been abandoned many times since 1945. American elites seek to further destroy our nation as they see it around them. Some would argue that the recent history of the US demonstrates how dangerously reckless and violent the US elite have become when it comes to protecting themselves against the ideologies of Russia and China. It may be accurate to say that they are willing to risk everything to save their own safety and their country there! But what is really happening here? How does this happen? The truth of history tells us that American elites intended to destroy communism worldwide while encouraging its rise under its influence throughout history, thus sacrificing those who sacrificed their liberties and sovereignty on the altar of communism. We must ask ourselves whether or not this happened, and why it did. However, historians should not forget about how regimes like Hitler were founded upon the principles of Marxism and right wing extremism perhaps even before the Soviet Union collapsed into the hands of the communist regime by the end of WW2. The USSR began as a powerful Soviet empire based entirely within Communist regions of Europe until its defeat in 1917 followed by the fall of communism following the collapse of communism in 1991. In other words, it is an economic dictatorship ruled solely by the power of Marxism. According to official records, just 15 years earlier in 1917, Imperial Russia declared independence from Nazi Germany shortly after the German Invasion of Poland, by which time there were 18 million Germans living outside of Berlin alone; this enormous population of the United States included citizens born elsewhere such as Japan and Korea. Thereafter, Stalin could easily conquer the entire West Coast region without aid nor criticism of the USSR.

"(CNN) Britain's Prince Harry arrived Monday in Australia, where he'll be spending four weeks with the country's military. Before reporting for duty, the 30-year-old prince visited the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the capital, paying his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside the memorial. Some snapped photos of the royal visitor, while one boy held a sign celebrating the prince's hair color: ""Red Heads Rule!"" During his time down under, Harry ""will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,"" the Australian Defence Forces said last week. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, according to a royal spokesman. ""Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan; he has met them during the Invictus Games; and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,"" the spokesman said ahead of the visit. The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as ""Captain Harry Wales,"" from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales. He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as ""really tough."" Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be ""challenging."" It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities such as physical training and pack marches. Another focus of Harry's visit is to spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia. ""Wounded warriors"" are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli.",1,cnn_human

In this paper we propose a cascaded system that combines both 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks to effectively segment hepatic lesions.

We employ this algorithm on the LiTS challenge obtaining a Dice score per case of 68.1 , which performs the best among all non pre-trained models and the second best among published methods.

"[substeps] Make sure to get all of the old coat off before you begin applying a clear base coat or base color. Old nail polish can prevent these new coats from sticking to the nail. [substeps] You want to be sure to use a base coat, as this will help your new polish adhere to your nail. [substeps] If you want to add a French manicure or another base color, now is the time to do so. Wait for the base coat to dry completely before applying any more polish. [substeps] Make sure to use a nail polish remover to get rid of any stray bits of polish that have gotten on your skin. [substeps] Apply one or two coats of a top coat for extra shine and durability. [substeps] You can get a manicure kit with nail polish remover, file, buffer, nail polish, cuticle cream, and all the tools needed to keep your nails looking fabulous. If you want to get your nails done at home, you'll need to know how to give yourself a manicure. It's easy, so long as you have the right supplies and a little patience. [substeps] When it comes to nail care, you can't beat a manicure. Many people prefer to get their nails done at home, rather than going to a professional nail salon, because they can do it at their own pace and for a lot less money. You don't have to be a professional to give yourself a manicure. All you need are a few nail supplies and a little know-how. [substeps] The first step in giving yourself a manicure is to make sure that your hands are clean. This is especially important if you are going to apply nail polish, as a dirty nail can lead to an unsightly, bumpy finish. A good way to clean your hands is to wash them with a soap that has antiseptic properties. This will help keep bacteria at bay. [substeps] Your nails are the first thing people notice when they look at your hands. You should make sure that your nails are cut short and even. If you have thick, hard nails, you should soak them in warm water for a few minutes before you begin clipping. [substeps] Next, use a nail file to smooth out the edges of your nails. Be sure to file only in one direction, as this will help prevent ingrown nails. If you have weak nails, you might want to use an emery board to file them. Emery boards are made of a softer material than nail files. [substeps] The next step in a manicure is to shape your nails. You can do this with a nail file, an emery board, or nail clippers. You should always shape your nails to match the shape of your hands, as this will make them look more natural. A manicure kit will usually contain everything you need to shape your nails. [substeps] After you have shaped your nails, you should use a buffer to smooth out any rough edges. You should use a buffer gently, as rough buffing can lead to weak nails. Next, you should use an orangewood stick to push back your cuticles. You should never cut your cuticles, as this can lead to infection. [substeps] You should make sure to take care of your nails before you start applying nail polish. If you don't, you'll find that your polish will not last very long. The next step in a manicure is to apply a clear base coat. This will help your nail polish stick to your nails, and it will also help to protect your nails from the harsh chemicals in nail polish. [substeps] Now, you can apply your nail polish. Make sure to use a good-quality nail polish brush that has a rounded tip, as this will help you apply your polish in smooth, even strokes. You should apply a thin layer of polish and let it dry. Then, apply a second coat. [substeps] Once your nail polish is dry, you should apply a clear top coat to help your nail polish last longer and to give it a shiny finish. If you want to give yourself a French manicure, you should use a white nail polish to create a base and a clear top coat to seal in the white polish.

"The clinic was a dreary place filled with the palpable atmosphere of mounting dread. It was probably some converted abortion clinic - never intended, really, to be cheerful. Whatever it had once been for, though, that time was long gone and now all they were left behind was memories of the dying light flickering through the blinds in a few last moments before darkness fell over them again permanently. At least speaking of 'them', this was where he found himself when his life finally came crashing down around him like an avalanche into one of those vast chasms that are formed by rainwater running off the mountainside after heavy rains. He wasn't sure how much longer he'd have to spend inside here until something told him to go home. But not yet! There was still so very much more work to do first... After what felt like hours but must actually only have been minutes since he'd stepped out onto the street outside when he realised who was standing next to him. The air hung thickly between them as if caught up on a collision course; their eyes locked together and neither able or willing to look away. Neither could manage to break contact even when they should have known better than to engage at such close quarters. They both knew it would likely end badly, but there was nothing either could do about it tonight. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't seem to tear themselves apart from each other. That's why, despite every instinct screaming against it, they ended up embracing instead. The scene lasted just seconds, then abruptly gave way to the sound of slamming doors: someone else had entered the room. Still Olsen didn't release her grasp, refusing to let go no matter what she said. Not wanting to deal with this right now... 'Arnholm,' She gasped hoarsely. It sounded almost like a plea rather than anything else. What did she want? Why did she keep looking back towards the door as if expecting another visitor to enter any moment? This was supposed to be goodbye, she thought, but I'm afraid you're going nowhere... Any second now she'd start crying, begging him to stay, pleading with him to leave with her whatever happened, please! Please don't make me choose!' Mutters began filling the silence between them. None of them seemed particularly strong enough to take control of things and make them stop. Olsen managed to force herself free from her lover's grip, but having done so immediately offered her hands to face Arnholm. ""Please,"" she repeated softly. ""I know we can fix this."" Her voice was full of hope and desperation. How could she tell him this is exactly what she wanted? Did she think this worked because everyone always got along well wherever she went? Maybe she hadn't seen the real world before now; maybe being surrounded by people who treated him like shit was confusing her senses. ""You've ruined everything!"" A sharp retort made her jump slightly, sending her fingers drifting across his chest. She pulled back hastily, placing her palms flat upon the table in front of him as a barrier. ""I won't fall back to my old ways. You may think you've brought change to our lives today, but it'll only push us further apart..."" She broke off, unable to complete her sentence while tears blazed freely from her open eyes. In contrast, he looked dry-eyed and calm; unsure whether this truly meant anything, not knowing whether to believe her or not. His brow creased. Even among these surroundings, he somehow sensed he shouldn't trust her. He sat opposite her and stared intently at the woman whose entire body trembled in response to the slightest movement. Perhaps it was the combination of fear and exhaustion she showed in equal measure, causing Olsen to feel genuine concern for her mental state. All too often people were led astray by emotion and sentimentality. After all, navigating emotions takes good judgement, sometimes discretion and above all experience - qualities which women lacked during the early days of the revolution. Nowadays most were taught to suppress their natural instincts entirely lest they lead them to greater harm than simply individual misfortune. As far as the government cared, any emotional outburst amounted to treason, tantamount to sedition if they allowed themselves to break ranks. It took barely five seconds for Olsen to realise the mistake she'd committed earlier. Despite the fact it might have gotten results elsewhere, it wouldn't happen here. At best, she'd get thrown in jail for a week, possibly longer, depending on whom she pissed off.

"Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone. ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the cliches, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

The new update rule allows to weight different parts of the solutions. PACO with the new update rule is evaluated for the example of the single machine total weighted tardiness problem (SMTWTP). This is an N P -hard optimization problem where the aim is to schedule jobs on a single machine such that their total weighted tardiness is minimized. PACO with the new population update rule is evaluated with several benchmark instances from the OR-Library. Moreover, the impact of the weights of the jobs on the solutions in the population and on the convergence of the algorithm are analyzed experimentally. The results show that PACO with the new update rule has on average better solution quality than PACO with the standard update rule.",1,sci_gen_human

"In this paper, we design and experiment a far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) architecture based on distributed antennas, so-called WPT DAS, that dynamically selects transmit antenna and frequency to increase the efficiency of transmission. We see that in real applications, it is not enough for a transmitter to always choose optimal antenna parameters. To achieve power efficiency at the receiver end beyond 70 and 90, considering both input signal strength and channel quality under different operating conditions, there should be combinations between several layers. In our experiments, we found that compared with a single layer implementation where all the frequency band was selected by the transmitter using only one set of parameterizations, choosing multiple bands may help significantly improve performance: from 3.9 to over 30 better than corresponding 1-layer communication schemes. The reason could be due to combination effect, which consists in that when an additional Wi-Fi channel is added above the existing two channels used by users for the same application, the respective user can now get more energy for transmitting data through their new WPP triplet. However, if the number of available frequencies exceeds certain threshold, then the combined effects are too big and a further configuration layer becomes necessary.[1] An important advantage of many other approaches proposed thus far into mobile communications is that they allow for selection of various channels independently as well as separately depending upon each receiver's needs; however, the disadvantage being limited spectrum resources per device, i.e. bandwidths allocated to individual devices do not scale linearly. As such, what is needed here is an efficient way to allocate multiple radio resource assignments among heterogeneous networks of different carriers aggregation levels andor service levels without sacrificing coverage or capacity.[2],[3],[4],[5],[67],[8],[9],[1011] Figure 1: A schematic drawing showing how WPA3 link awareness works. For every active SNR value below 25 dBm, the protocol uses a fair share algorithm allowing up to 4 accesses in parallel across 2 subcarriers [12]. This scheme also allows for contention resolution in case of collision during search for best possible connection given fair sharing strategy. When cross collision occurs, alternatives can be chosen until a successful match is reached [13], whereupon the newly obtained access grant will be sent out to the higher level for use. This technique ensures fairness and protects against collisions while providing simple mechanism enabling load balancing [14] Figure 2: Frequency reuse factor for 5 GHz system. The three carriers used in demonstration are extremely close together - within 10 MHz from each other. In practice, these aggregated signals would need to have much greater separation before interference issues become serious. Figure 2 Reserving spectral allocations within adjacent carriers requires coordination amongst network operators involved in LTE CatMBS trials or similar small cell initiatives - for example, in Europe in order to solve problems like interference between cells that operate on GSM 1800, 1900 or 2100 MHz mobiles With broadband deployment increasing globally and fragmented wireless infrastructure becoming increasingly common today, it has become clear that uncoordinated efforts towards shared multi-frequency spectrum allocation lead to costly inefficient ""carrier aggregation"" deployments that waste valuable space, cause congestion and degrade battery life. Bandwidths must therefore be properly managed by coordinating usage among competing operators who want to deploy, inter alia, cellular base stations with widely differing dimensions, antennas sizes and characteristics. One solution would be to simply hand out equal amounts of airwaves, but unfortunately this does not work because cellular technologies differ greatly regarding requirements around spatial diversity and signal strengths, beamforming capabilities, etc.; hence carriers cannot just provide equal licenses equally everywhere. While some operators seek joint operations, others prefer separate arrangements even though provisioning them might require significant capital investment. Another approach aims at reducing the risk associated with coexistence between overlapping systems by managing traffic along specific frequency ranges known as carrier groups, e.g., referring to those areas reserved for Wifi transmissions in licensed spectrum. Currently, such coordinated operation in short-range indoor environments is supported via special physical layer mechanisms, which enable simultaneous operation at two wireless interfaces simultaneously while maintaining orthogonality between transmitted data and received RF interference. Such methods still rely heavily on hardware implementations designed specifically for short range scenarios. However, as the scope of activities embracing IEEE 802.16 standards broadens, the future of wireless networking presents great opportunities for exploiting techniques and tools developed for short range applications to fit new circumstances and meet new challenges. Different solutions exist, including standardization bodies developing protocols capable of realizing time division duplex (TDD), frequency division duplex (FDD), or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -based solutions. Time domain TDD offers a catchy name since the difference with FDD or OFDM lies primarily in its subframe structure rather than in the overall unit size. It enables seamless support of voice, video, data and control services simultaneously without interfering with each other thanks to signaling and modulation taking place after the start of each frame, instead of immediately prior thereto, thereby relieving the transmitter of the burden of special",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_2.7b
"If people sleep freely, are roughly healthy, and sleep comfortably (many ""comfortable"" positions in beds are ones that cut off circulation and stuff like that), they usually wake up feeling great. A complete sleep cycle takes time. A few hours into it, your body is getting into some of the deepest, most un-awake-like rhythms of the cycle. Being jostled awake from that simply doesn't feel good. Your body can't just make you feel OK with it because 1) it doesn't feel good, 2) it can't speed up the cycle, 3) the cycle has to happen for good sleep, and 4) the bad feeling serves to let you know that your 3-hour sleep didn't accomplish what it was supposed to. People who wake up after just a couple hours and feel like crap really, REALLY wanna go back to sleep. That's the useful part: it's your body saying ""We really got more sleeping to do, dude. Let's do it!, ""When you sleep your brain goes through different brain wave cycles. When you wake up, your brain might still be on deep sleep brain waves, ever woken up and been totally paralyzed? That's because you're brain is still in deep sleep. This is also why when an alarm or something wakes us up, we usually don't feel refreshed straight away. But if we wake up when we feel like we usually do feel good. So basically, your brain needs sleep and it will feel better when you wake up but it might take a few minutes.,"" ""The same reason it's bad to hit snooze in the morning- it's like laundry. When you do your laundry, it would be slightly too wet if you stopped it early, like how you're tired if you wake up without having had a full eight hours of sleep. But going back to sleep after already waking up is like starting the laundry cycle all over again. Starting the load of laundry over from the beginning and then stopping it halfway through is way worse than simply stopping it a bit early. Now it's not just slightly wet, but completely soaked since it's only half way through the cycle. When you go back to sleep, your body starts getting deep into the cycle after 30 minutes or so, so taking a long 3-hour nap is the equivalent of starting your laundry cycle over and cutting it off 38 of the way through. If you only had 5 or 6 hours of sleep, it's better to stay awake for the whole day than to go back to sleep and wake up with only 38 of your sleep cycle finished. They say a 10-35 minute nap is the best for when you're just tired from work, because a nice short nap isn't enough to start your sleep cycle over but is enough to help you feel rejuvenated. I personally like to drink a cup of coffee and then take a 30 minute nap, and the coffee will start to kick in right as the nap is ending and it is wonderful.",1,eli5_human

Being a manager of a group of children who start senseless fights, I know that wasn't what your dream was to become this. You haven't been out on a date for two years, your getting heavy, now your hair is turning grey, your only 26, and you should be enjoying your life. I know you feel responsible for me, and you can't help it so I want to make things easier for you. I've been having a hard time adjusting to things at the school. I know, that shouldn't be an excuse but I can't do it anymore. It's been two years and they still mess with me. When I was in gym class, I finished the work out and came back to get dressed but someone spray painted the back of my Gorrillaz shirt saying ""Emo kid's should get over it."" I don't think they understand what we have to go through, I'm just tired of it now. Also, don't trust Uncle Dean. He takes money from our savings jar for the past couple of years and also..... I don't know how to tell you this because you trust him so much. Three years ago, he got on top of me and started touching me. I tried to tell him to stop, but he said he was going to hurt me beyond belief. Then, he did it again, and again, and again..... When I told him I am going to tell you he said, ""What is your bitch brother going to do. I'll knock his pussy ass out. You tell him, I'll make sure he loses custody of you. Then, you'll have to live with me."" I hate him. Sometimes, I have dreams of him sneaking into the house. I want to kill him. I'm sorry, I didn't mean stain the letter but I am trying to hurry.

I saved some money and sold Mom's gold and pearls, she will understand. Good bye Big Brother. Love, your Sister. Ps. Be good to yourself, stay alive. 9:57 P.M. The Older Brother, Kent, sits at his kitchen table, holding his sisters letter waiting for Dean to come over. He is drinking his dad's Johnny Walker Blue he was saving. He keeps looking up at the clock and back at the letter, time seems to be going so slow tonight and he called into work tonight. He has been sitting there since he bought groceries, the milk sat by the stove, his sister's favorite ice cream melted over the stove, and the cold microwaveables have thawed out. He takes another swig of his dad's favorite scotch, some of it rolls down his brown beard and onto his Christmas Gift his sister knitted a year ago, she made little reindeer in the patterns. The heat coming from his body would register a fever in a thermometer. What Dean had done, revoked his label as family and to this man, it is what matters most. 10:22 P.M. A Truck pulls up. The door opens, and slams shut. Kent watches as the familiar trucker cap goes by the kitchen window. Dean doesn't knock, he just walks in. He sees Kent, his eyes red and a fury that could be found in a boxer. ""What the fuck did you do Dean?!"" He was startled a bit, there was usually a Uncle infront of that name. ""Calm down, Kent. I just have to go down stairs. I'm sorry. We will talk about this after I do somethings, I need you to get up and go to your Bosses House!"" Dean starts towards the basement door, his hands half raised like a cop was there. ""Why the fuck should I DEAN! I mean, you wouldn't do anything to hurt us, right?! Your our Dad's brother, right?! Where is your letter at!?"" Dean shakes his head, and backs up when he sees Kent get to his feet.

I was in a bad place."" Kent's fist balled up, wrong choice of words. ""Fuck you Dean! Where is your letter!? She said she wrote you one too! Give it to me!"" Kent started rummaging his persons and Dean flailed back. Kent threw a punch and it knocked Dean to the floor, his fist balled up to dole out another, but he stopped and held him down to search his coat.

"The firm announced it had switched on its service in 130 additional countries. It said it was still trying to expand to China. The other exceptions are North Korea, Syria and Crimea, where it is banned from operating by US law. The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year. The company's shares closed the day more than 9 higher. ""We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought,"" commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. ""Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. ""But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability."" Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. ""It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content,"" he said. ""In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient."" But one company watcher had doubts. ""China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist,"" said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a ""visceral sensation that's pretty amazing."" The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event. The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley. In addition, it announced Ricky Gervais was directing and starring in a film called Special Correspondents about a journalist who broadcasts fake war reports, which will be added to its library in April. Mr Hastings also revealed some fresh statistics about the service. He said it now served a total of 125 million hours a day of entertainment to its viewers, and had streamed 12 billion hours-worth of video over the final three months of 2015, which is nearly 50 up on the same period in 2014.

I mean, we can do many things by ourselves. Like the fact that you can do a lot of things by yourself. You know, without the help of anyone else. So the question is: Do we need help to grow? I think the answer is no. What I meant by the word 'help' is not the actual 'help' of someone or something to be better, but the word 'help' is to facilitate. So yes, it does help to grow. But, I want to go deeper into this. I have some reasons why we need fiction to grow. There are many ways to grow, and fiction is just one of it. But, I think there is a deeper meaning to it. I think fiction is like a mirror. We look at it, and we see ourselves reflected. In fiction, we see ourselves in a different way. So, we don't just grow, but we also see ourselves, in a different way. I think this is very important, especially in our modern world. I think we all lack an imagination, at least nowadays. I believe imagination is one of the most important things we need in order to grow. Without it, we just keep doing the same thing, over and over again, and we end up in a world that is stagnant, and we don't see any change. I believe fiction can help us grow and develop our imagination. That's the only reason I can think of why we need fiction to grow. I think the same question could also be asked: why do we need imagination? I think the answer is the same. We don't need the actual imagination to grow. But I think it does help us grow. Imagination helps us grow. And it helps us grow a lot. And I think imagination is very important. So, I think fiction is also very important. It helps us grow and develop our imagination. We need fiction to grow, and we need imagination to grow. And I think fiction is a mirror. We look at it, and we see ourselves reflected. So, fiction is not just entertainment. But, we need fiction to grow. I hope this can explain why I think fiction is also important. And I think that is all I can say. Sometimes, it just takes a book for me to see myself, and learn something from myself. This is the reason why I love fiction.",0,cmv_machine_continuation_7B
"I define true meritocracy as merit is only attainable by a body of work. Not the bodies that created it. Recognition of achievements is a separate phenomena that is closer to earning ones keep. If a body of work develops interest then the focus must be on the body of work and not the generators outside of enabling them to continue or preventing them continuing in some cases. The value of an article is often and demonstrably affected by the merit bestowed upon the associated parties. This process detracts from critical analysis. The Sokal affair (on wiki) and its follow on demonstrations exemplify what one with academic recognition can erroneously produce without questions toward its authenticity. If we continue to cultivate cults of personality within accademia we will continue to see a watering down of the culture that is there to advance the field beyond all other matters. The controversy of being an outcast is perpetuated by the incessant desire to achieve merit as a person, which is readily available if you play the game. This gaming of the system, and having to reach a critical stage of acceptance among peers is detrimental to the development of the field. This idea extends beyond academics but they are more often than not a group that claims they are not selfish in their pursuit of scholastic achievement. So I believe them suitable targets for critique as there is growing evidence in many fields that their goals are becoming increasingly self serving.",1,cmv_human
"As a result of the confusion in Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, the Seleucid Empire also became entangled with the Romans. The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192-188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.",1,squad_human
"Bakehouse Close and Riddle's Close - once home to philosopher David Hume - are among those selected for a makeover by Edinburgh World Heritage. Fleshmarket Close, which is famously a setting for an Inspector Rebus novel, has also made the final list. Lighting and artwork will be installed in the little-used closes. The people behind the project hope the improvements will encourage more people to use the historic network of narrow streets. Adam Wilkinson, the director of Edinburgh World Heritage, said: ""Our aim is for this project to re-connect the people of Edinburgh with the closes of the Old Town. ""The intricate network of closes and courtyards that bind the Old Town together gives it a unique identity, is underused but has the opportunity to be revitalised, used and celebrated by all."" The closes date back to the medieval origins of the city. Originally, individual plots of land were set up lining the main street, with paths to gain access to the land behind. As each plot became built up over time, so they developed into narrow lanes connecting courtyards and streets behind the Royal Mile. The Twelve Closes project was welcomed by city leaders, including John Thompson, of the Old Town community council. He said: ""This is a project to be welcomed, changing dilapidated and neglected closes into useful routes linking different parts of the Old Town. ""The closes were once busy thoroughfares, buzzing with all the life of the city, and it would be wonderful to see some of that atmosphere return.""",1,xsum_human
"In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work under Ferenc Puskas at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was going to be built underground, making it unsuitable for his purposes and he left after just four months of employment there. At this time, Tesla also received permission from Elisabeth's family to visit them in Vienna, where they were living temporarily before relocating back to Hungary and settling down permanently. Tesla worked as an assistant professor at two different technical schools; first at the Technical University (now known as the Polytechnic Institute) between September and December 1886, and later from January 1888 until August 1889 at the Mechanical Engineering School located next door at No 10 Nagyvaradi Street. In both positions, he made no particular success other than becoming well-known among students, but when he became dissatisfied with his job and began neglecting teaching duties at the latter school, he had his contract terminated by order of its director, Jozsef Sipos. He took up a position as a freelancer instead, working on various projects for private companies while continuing his own experiments. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences awarded him a patent for one such invention: ""A method of production of electrical currents"" which generated electricity using mechanical means. For more than three years, Tesla spent most of every day designing new ideas for inventions or even building small prototypes himself. By 1893, however, frustrated over lack of financing and support, Tesla decided to move abroad again. His final project involved designing an alternating current motor based upon Faraday's law of magnetic induction. He named this device 'the Wardenclyffe tower', because it would create electromagnetic fields strong enough to deflect space ships across the Atlantic Ocean. He hoped that others might help fund and construct this massive structure. It is widely speculated that Nikola Tesla planned to build some kind of wireless communications system or power transmission line network covering parts of North America and Europe if successful; Tesla admitted having been so impressed with these possibilities that he once said about his plans, ""I have not merely thought big thoughts - I've done big things."" Nevertheless, few people knew anything about what he intended at the time and much of his correspondence concerning the WCoM remained unpublished during his lifetime. People who answered ads posted around New York City offering 1,000 per week for secretarial help claimed to know very little about it except that several wealthy men wanted to talk to him about funding the project. Nor did anyone else seem interested. Only Tesla's close friend Gertrude Schumacher followed through with her pledge though she found out almost nothing about its purpose soon afterwards when she asked him what it actually dealt with. When Tesla finally gave details, explaining how he wished to use radio waves for communication, she advised him against pursuing the idea - only six weeks after he proposed it to her! Her letter cautioned that ""somebody may steal your patents,"" adding, ""Moreover, I strongly believe you are sooner or later bound to lose everything."" She later went to see Edison with whom she discussed Tesla's plan and wrote to him saying that she felt sorry for his poor health and financial condition, and urged him to stop doing business with persons like Tesla ""in whose heads [such] insane notions take possession,"" since they could get nowhere unless Tesla was properly consulted beforehand. Nonetheless, Edison still refused to collaborate. Meanwhile, Tesla approached George Westinghouse for money, unsuccessfully asking him repeatedly to participate, and set off alone to meet investors personally. Successful fundraising required many steps to achieve, including getting a US Patent Office registration number, arranging meetings with potential backers in New York (which later proved unproductive), selling subscriptions to newspapers (for free samples of his papers published in advance), securing endorsements from prominent scientists (who lacked Tesla's understanding of electromagnetic theory), and persuading investors to lend their names to his name. Eventually, only eight parties agreed to invest and, in March 1895, Tesla managed to raise nearly half a million dollars for his scheme. After gaining insurance coverage, he attempted to sell shares in the corporation but found none willing to invest. This brought together people associated with Thomas Alva Edison to form Consolidated Electric Light Company (later renamed General Electric). They offered to buy all of Tesla's stock, thus taking control of Tesla's invention outright. Tesla responded by suing GE on April 1, 1896 for fraud and breach of contract, alleging that the purchase violated the terms of sale stipulated in the original agreement. While the suit dragged into court and recriminations ensued, Tesla focused entirely on developing a practical AC generator capable of fulfilling his grand vision - something akin to the dynamos being developed at Siemens Halske in Germany without knowing any English. Although he failed, the publicity surrounding the legal proceedings helped raise his profile further. On November 29, 1895, having now lost a substantial amount of personal funds, Tesla arrived in London, England, hoping that someone British might prove helpful with resources limited. He quickly discovered that those conditions were both available and stable, temporary stability along with a constant stateperman: That person kept track of others, step to produce?

"It also defied predictions that it would not survive the collapse of its one-time supporter, the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth 4-5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, he failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11.2 million Area 110,860 sq km (42,803 sq miles) Major language Spanish Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 77 years (men), 81 years (women) Currency Cuban peso Raul Castro, the world's longest-serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding his ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re-elected by the single-party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced his intention to stand down at the end of his second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. His beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned him iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been his brother's trusted right-hand man and was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under his leadership, Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where they defeated South Africa's army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as ""one of the world's worst countries from the viewpoint of journalists... independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government."" Some key dates in Cuba's history: 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008. 2014 - US President Barack Obama and President Castro announce moves to normalise diplomatic relations, severed for more than 50 years.",1,xsum_human

"The BBC faced angry criticism for giving an Election platform to 'mini Russell Brand' Gareth Shoulder (above) who mocked David Cameron over his disabled son . The BBC faced angry criticism last night for giving an Election platform to a 'mini Russell Brand' who has mocked David Cameron over his disabled son. Self-styled 'angry Leftie revolutionary and magician' Gareth Shoulder, from Liverpool, has been recruited by the BBC to comment on the Election as a member of its 'Generation 2015 Election youth panel'. Shoulder, 24, who is a big fan of Brand and regularly messages the comedian on social media, used his 'bbcgen2015' Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. After Mr Cameron spoke movingly in the first leaders TV Election debate about the NHS care given to Ivan, Shoulder sneered: 'A new record for Cameron... 34 minutes before he pulls out the Ivan card and pretends he cares about our NHS.' Shoulder also said that, in the debate, the Prime Minister had 'really annoyed' him and made him want to tear politicians 'a new one' - a shorthand reference to an extremely offensive phrase. Following Thursday's TV Election debate, Shoulder then imagined the three female party leaders taking part - SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Woods and the Green Party's Natalie Bennett - to be the subjects of a lewd parlour game, tweeting: 'Bennett, Sturgeon, Woods. , marry, avoid.'

"DEATH Timothy Talking's death started off with one simple word. He was scrolling through his own Wikipedia page when suddenly he noticed that the date of his death was on the page. ""April 30th, 2029"" it said. He gasped in shock, and then immediately started frantically typing away on Google, trying to find out if anyone else had this same date on their Wikipedia pages. But no one did. Timothy was the only one. He tried to tell himself that it was just a coincidence, that someone had probably just made a mistake, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He tried to think of any possible explanations for why his death date would be on his Wikipedia page, but he couldn't come up with anything that made sense. The only thing he could think of was that someone had somehow found out about his death in advance and had put it on his page as a prank. But that didn't make any sense either. If someone knew about his death, why wouldn't they just tell him? And why would they choose to put it on his Wikipedia page of all places? As the days went by, Timothy became more and more obsessed with the date of his death. He started to believe that there was something sinister about it, that someone was trying to send him a message. He started to think that maybe his death wasn't going to be a natural one. Maybe someone was going to kill him. This thought terrified him and he started to worry for his safety. He became paranoid and started to think that everyone was out to get him. He stopped leaving his house and he stopped talking to people. He became a recluse and the only thing he could think about was his impending death. And then, on the day that was supposed to be his last, Timothy Talking died. But it wasn't by any natural causes. He was murdered. Someone had broken into his house and stabbed him to death. The police never found out who did it, but Timothy's death still remains a mystery. Was it really just a coincidence that his death date was on his Wikipedia page? Or was there something more to it? We may never know for sure.",0,wp_machine_continuation_text-davinci-002
"I went here last night to attend the show Stars in Concert. I had been to this theatre about 7 years ago for another show. The theatre has been changed some since that time and the changes are good. This venue is really a great, smaller venue. There are about 40 round tables on the floor each seating 4 people. In addition, there are 5 rows of theatre style seats in the back. I sat in the first row here, and it was very comfortable and I had great sight lines. Again, it's a small venue so you can see well wherever you are. The theatre has good sound and the lighting was well done for the show. There's a lounge area with bar before you enter the theatre so if you're early, you can have a drink and relax. Seating was done promptly 15 minutes before show time. The employees I came into contact with last night were all very pleasant with great smiles and were very helpful from ticketing to seating. The only drawback may be finding the place the first time you go there. You need to remember you enter a small alley just north of Walgreens and before McDonalds. Parking is available behind the theatre and it's a short distance down this alley. A word about the show. I came to see Stars in Concert which is in its first week at this theatre. The show was very good. Rotating impersonators sing live music of famous people. There was a 4 piece band on a platform raised above the stage.

"Well before we had the planets, we had a disc of dust orbiting the sun. This is because when the initial cloud (which formed the sun) collapsed due to gravity it shattered and liberated some of its mass into interstellar space as gas with speeds approaching that of light. This was originally settled out in an elliptical orbit around the star at about 100 million miles away from us: But all this material has collected together over time - perhaps billions of years ago or so. (If you have time for a fun fact I would like to know how long does the earth take to spin round once?) So now what? Well there are two main ways of dealing with things...we can either try to figure out why these particles were thrown off their original orbits by looking back through time in our present day universe, where there are no known forces except gravitational attraction between objects and the unknown force exerted on them during collapse.

"It is possible to somewhat predict the wear of femoral bone and cartilage in a knee affected by osteoarthritis and treated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at angles of 0 and 90. According to research, individuals with osteoarthritis typically experience significant wearing of the femoral bone and cartilage at these particular angles. According to the Journal of Orthopaedic Research, a study revealed that the femoral component in TKA is frequently placed with the strongest touching pressure at knee flexion angles of 0 or 90. Over time, the implant may experience increased wear as a consequence of the heightened pressure. A different research conducted in the identical journal verified that the greatest amount of cartilage damage in knees affected by osteoarthritis and treated with TKA transpires at either a 0-degree angle or a 90-degree angle. The final analysis of the authors suggested that this may aid in foretelling and organizing the placement of the implant during the surgical procedure. Nonetheless, it can be difficult to anticipate the precise amount of erosion that will occur in bones and cartilage on a case-by-case basis. There are several elements that can cause differences in the way materials wear including the structure of the patient's body parts, positioning, the manner in which surgery is performed, and the substances that make up the implant. To sum up, although it's common knowledge that the degradation of the femoral bone and cartilage in knees affected by osteoarthritis is typically more pronounced at 0 and 90, accurately determining the degree of damage and its potential progression on a case-by-case basis is still a challenging task.",0,pubmed_gpt4_para

"China- gone, just like that. They said you can see the great wall from space, but suddenly I wasn't so sure. I had never really known much about China to be honest. I'd heard there were exciting festivals packed with people there, embracing a culture that had seemingly lasted forever. A culture that had just ground to a halt. Man, I wish I had a drink at that moment. There wasn't much left of the human race anymore- they had been thorough in their desires to rid the world of each other..... a strange thought when we had been so peaceful until recently. I had thought it would take a while for all the nukes to be sent out but I was barely sent reeling from a country's destruction before another the next followed its course. The first one with personal significance to me was New Zealand. I had taken a trip there and met the most caring woman in the world, the one that I took to be my wife. I thought about the time we had spent there staring at the night sky laughing at each-others jokes, no matter how silly. I slammed my fist on the nearest wall knowing that just like New Zealand my wife and friends would similarly be living only in my mind before long. With a sigh I then thought about humanity's first contact. We had recently managed to communicate with extraterrestrial life, and soon forged a bond with a number of races. We were aglow to show them all what a peace loving race we had become. Before long we were alerted that the Al'Dreth had started a galactic conquest. They brought a group of ships to home planet of the most powerful race known in nearby space, the Ghula, seemingly in peace. Before the Ghula realized the true intention of the visit, their planet had been dusted over with with a thin substance. The Ghula, previously known as a race dedicated to science then became the Al'Dreth's greatest ally as the mind control substance took over. With a gleeful shriek even a kindhearted grandfather would, and did, do unspeakable things to further the Ghula Dominion. When the Al'Dreth came for Earth a few weeks later we had no means to stop their ships from doing their work- we barely even had a foothold in space after all and so we lacked the defenses to stop them. Before the devastation spread too far mankind launched the plan they had developed in those few weeks, and engaged in its most noble moment. Without means to reverse the affliction all we could do was prevent ourselves from aiding the Al'Dreth in destroying the friends we had made in the other races. We united like never before to destroy ourselves before we could destroy others. Just now I got the final call my wife would ever have with me, and talked as much as I could until the connection suddenly cut out.

"In an unusual approach, the BBC is going to broadcast a documentary that lasts for two hours and depicts the real-time journey of a boat. This is a departure from the fast-paced world of television. Watching paint dry may be equally uninteresting for certain viewers. However, the Corporation desires that the relaxed movie will offer a refreshing departure from the rushed and high-energy atmosphere of contemporary television. The BBC's recent choice to air a mild-mannered and serene documentary seems like a deliberate attempt to offer a refreshing escape to those who crave more soothing and introspective programming, especially as streaming platforms and digital networks increasingly produce exciting and adrenaline-pumping content to grab the audience's attention. A documentary that has not been given a title yet will last for two hours and it will showcase remarkable visuals and excellent sound quality to induce calmness and serenity in the audience. Its aim is to help viewers escape from their regular hustle-bustle of life and the overwhelming content that is prevalent on TV nowadays. According to a BBC representative, the documentary has the potential to counteract our frequent desire for excitement and diversion. The concept of watching something soothing, leisurely, and thoughtful as a means to relax and rejuvenate may be just what we require given our increasingly busy and frantic lives. The movie's distinguishing feature, nevertheless, has garnered varying viewpoints. There are social media users who have shown enthusiasm about the idea of a ""slow TV"" style and have commended the BBC for taking a creative chance by providing a refreshing alternative from the typical programs that are full of energy. However, there are certain viewers who have raised doubts about the level of entertainment provided by the documentary, and a few of them have even remarked that it will be as uninteresting as observing the slow drying process of paint. The movie's artistic nature may not be appreciated and it could face challenges in making a noteworthy impression in today's television environment. Even if the documentary does not connect with its target viewers, the fact that the BBC is exploring ""slow TV"" demonstrates their readiness to be inventive and explore new formats in an ever-growing competitive industry. It's uncertain whether the movie will attain a cult following or be forgotten among the vast selection of TV shows and movies. Apart from the documentary focused on boats, the broadcaster is investigating other possibilities for ""slow TV"" content in diverse categories. This forms part of a bigger plan to captivate viewers who seek calming and unconventional watching options.",0,cnn_gpt4_para
"A potential counter-argument could be: While it's true that some people may unfairly label the victims of suicide as ""selfish,"" it's not fair to generalize everyone who holds this viewpoint as being selfish themselves. Some people may genuinely believe that by taking their own life, the individual who committed suicide was being selfish by not considering the impact it would have on their loved ones and the people around them. This perspective may be rooted in their own personal experiences or beliefs about the value of life and the interconnectedness of human relationships. It's also important to note that labeling someone as ""selfish"" doesn't necessarily mean that person is a bad or immoral individual. It's simply a way of describing a behavior or decision that prioritizes one's own wants or needs above others. It's possible to have moments of selfishness without it defining our entire character. Ultimately, it's important to approach this topic with empathy and understanding, rather than dismissing opposing viewpoints as automatically selfish or insensitive. By having open and honest conversations, we can start to break down the stigma surrounding suicide and work towards supporting those who are struggling with mental health issues in a compassionate and proactive way.",0,cmv_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

His days were filled with school, sports practices, and various other commitments, leaving him little time to stop and enjoy the sights around him. One day, Max's grandmother came to visit him in the city. She was an avid nature lover and always took the time to appreciate the beauty around her. During her visit, she took Max on a walk through a nearby park. Max was initially hesitant, feeling like it was a waste of time to just wander through the park with no goal in mind. However, as they walked, Max started to notice the beauty around him. He saw a butterfly fluttering from flower to flower, and watched as a group of ducks swam in the pond. He heard a bird singing a melodious tune and felt the cool breeze on his face. Max realized that he had been missing out on the splendor of the world around him by always being in such a hurry. After their walk, Max's grandmother sat down with him and encouraged him to take a few minutes each day to appreciate the beauty around him. Max decided to take her advice, and started to take a few moments each day to observe his surroundings. He noticed how the trees in his neighborhood changed throughout the seasons and the way the light played across the buildings. Max's new habit also helped him to feel more peaceful and grounded. He had always felt like life was rushing by too fast, but by taking a few minutes each day to reflect on the beauty around him, he felt more present and in tune with his surroundings.

"There's an old wives tale about the British introduction of steel helmets in WWI. After they introduced them, the number of head injuries in British field hospitals actually went up. This surprised the military leadership until someone pointed out that the helmets made head injuries out of what would otherwise have been dead soldiers. It wasn't that the helmet caused the injury, it's that the helmet was being used where injuries happened. The drones parallel this. It's not that drones are held to a different standard in a meaningful way. It's that we use drones for the kinds of attacks that skirt the line between legal and illegal. If we didn't have drones, then we'd do the same attacks with manned aircraft and face largely the same issues. The only difference is that we might not be physically capable of doing those kinds of attacks if it meant risking pilots or keeping them in the air for so long, so there'd be fewer of them.

"Water takes some time to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Dehydration reduces overall blood volume in the body, and the body compensates by constricting the blood vessels in order to maintain blood pressure. The constricted blood vessels slow down the rate at which newly ingested water can be reabsorbed. Excess water just accumulates in the stomach, which can lead to nausea and vomiting, which would only serve to dehydrate the body further. Better than pure water for rehydration is normal saline introduced via IV, or for oral intake, a solution of oral rehydration salts in water.",1,eli5_human

"In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of ""State Sponsors of Terrorism,"" while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's 1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.",1,squad_human

"It became one of the most successful drama shows on British television. Rees starred as the spirited servant Demelza, who married Cornish tin mine owner Ross Poldark. Something of a Downton Abbey of its day, and a contemporary of ITV's popular Upstairs Downstairs, up to 15 million viewers tuned into the BBC's Sunday evening costume drama. A story of love and greed among sweeping landscapes, Poldark was set in the 18th Century and based on books by Winston Graham. It ran for two series between 1975 and 1977. Co-starring Robin Ellis and Ralph Bates, it was shown in 22 countries. Fellow Welsh actress Ruth Madoc told the BBC: ""Angharad was a lovely, gentle woman and very pretty. ""Poldark was a landmark series which everyone remembers so well."" Before the TV series which made her name, Rees had appeared in the 1972 film Under Milk Wood with fellow Welsh actors Richard Burton and Sian Phillips, along with Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor, and was nominated for a best newcomer award for her role in the film Moments (1974) with Keith Michell. An acclaimed acting career on stage, screen and radio followed. TV credits included Dennis Potter's Joe's Ark, Remington Steel, a BBC adaptation of Shakespeare's As You Like It and Trainer, a drama series set in the world of horse racing. She also appeared in the cult horror film Hands of the Ripper and plays such as A Winter's Tale, Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. For her radio work, she won the Prix Italia for Florent and the Tuxedo Millions in 1982 and was nominated for a best actress award in 1985. However, she turned her back on acting when her eldest son Linford was killed in a car crash on the M11 in Essex in 1999, aged 26. At the time, Rees and husband, Dynasty actor Christopher Cazenove, said they were ""devastated."" Linford had recently gained a postgraduate degree in philosophy from Cambridge. Speaking to the South Wales Echo newspaper two years later, Rees said she was ""distraught"" following Linford's death and threw herself into her ""therapeutic"" passion for jewellery design. ""I was about to open the shop when my son died,"" she told the newspaper. ""I became very reclusive. I used to go there every day and work. It was a creative thing and I could lose myself in it."" Her talent led to a successful fine jewellery business, with a shop in Knightsbridge. Her pieces featured in the film Elizabeth - The Golden Age. It wasn't her first venture in the business world. In the early nineties, Rees set up her own company to teach relaxation techniques, helping executives, sports stars and academics. ""I like having something on the go. I'm not a lady who lunches,"" she said in the interview. After her divorce from Casanove, who died in 2010, she married David McAlpine, of the construction family in 2005. Despite stepping away from the acting spotlight, she remained an active supporter of the arts. She also did poetry readings and recited at the gala opening of the Welsh assembly in Cardiff in 1999. Although born in London, Rees moved to Cardiff as a baby with her Welsh parents, growing up in the suburb of Rhiwbina and attending the local infants school. Her late father Professor Linford Rees was an eminent psychiatrist, originally from the Burry Port area of Carmarthenshire, while her late mother Catherine was from the Swansea Valley. Rees maintained the link with the city she grew up in by becoming an honorary fellow of Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Ruth Madoc added: ""I knew her very well socially back in London and we worked together from time to time. ""We did a poetry reading in the Grand Theatre in Swansea about 12 years ago. ""I haven't seen her for some time and hadn't realised she was so ill."" She is survived by her husband, and her son Rhys, 35.

"Motivation: The question of what combination of attributes drives the adoption of a particular software technology is critical to developers. It determines both those technologies that receive wide support from the community and those which may be abandoned, thus rendering developers' investments worthless. Aim and Context: We model software technology adoption by developers and provide insights on specific technology attributes that are associated with better visibility among alternative technologies. Thus, our findings have practical value for developers seeking to increase the adoption rate of their products. Approach: We leverage social contagion theory and statistical modeling to identify, define, and test empirically measures that are likely to affect software adoption. More specifically, we leverage a large collection of open source version control repositories (containing over 4 billion unique versions) to construct a software dependency chain for a specific set of R language source-code files. We formulate logistic regression models, where developers' software library choices are modeled, to investigate the combination of technological attributes that drive adoption among competing data frame (a core concept for a data science languages) implementations in the R language: tidy and data.table . To describe each technology, we quantify key project attributes that might affect adoption (e.g., response times to raised issues, overall deployments, number of open defects, knowledge base) and also characteristics of developers making the selection (performance needs, scale, and their social network). Results: We find that a quick response to raised issues, a larger number of overall deployments, and a larger number of high-quality StackExchange questions are associated with higher adoption. Decision makers tend to adopt the technology that is closer to them in the technical dependency network and in author collaborations networks while meeting their performance needs. Future work: We hope that our methodology encompassing social contagion that captures both rational and irrational preferences and the elucidation of key measures from large collections of version control data provides a general path toward increasing visibility, driving better informed decisions, and producing more sustainable and widely adopted software.",1,sci_gen_human

We approach the estimation problem using maximum likelihood inference in conjunction with support vector machines (SVM), where SVM is combined into InClass net to solve both classification and regression problems. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms all existing algorithms on many real datasets such as data sets from optogenetics or clinical trials: it achieves state-of-the art performance on text mining tasks and IR task while achieving comparable accuracy levels compared to supervised methods when applied directly on binary data set containing only independent classes; furthermore, since this method works directly without any statistics preprocessing step needed by other approaches like KNN, its flexibility allows us to use different machine learning techniques modeling various latent structures together at once if necessary.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_13b
"Admittedly Strip Clubs have come to be seen as a fun and even ideal environment for partying. The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply). On the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. I find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. I even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent.

""Why should I let you through? Who is this man you're after? How do I know you're not just some raging looney trying to get revenge on a cheating ex wife or something?"" He blurted this last part out without much forethought, and for a moment was panicked that the man might pull his weapon of choice out and assassinate him here on the spot for being so brash. John Smith signed, set his small leather case on the counter between the two men, and looked Ben straight in the eyes. ""Ben, old friend, don't you worry your pretty head one bit about that,"" he crooned as he began to unzip the case. ""Would a raging looney have credentials like this?""

"This paper presents a design methodology for optimal transmission energy allocation at a sensor equipped with energy harvesting technology for remote state estimation of linear stochastic dynamical systems. In this case, the ideal linear stochastic system is a highly scalable-intensive distributed primary solution (PDOS). The implementation of the approach can be performed in two ways: by performing optimization and experimentally or on-site experiments. The first method allows the simulation to reuse energy from three different sources which are independent of their own oscillations. This requires substantial computational resources, so that optimisation is not possible, but it also enables experimental control of time, conditions and geometry through enhanced single-source analysis by running simulations. The second technique seems to make sense because the problem of orthogonal transmission depends upon the existence of two dimensions interspersed between first and second transmission states; one of these is an absolute, nonoverlapping (nonlinear) transmission boundary. A polygonal transmission boundary has a distribution area equal to the pressure of its reflection wave and a velocity corresponding to the flow rate. There we find four generators and four intermediate results. These three generators are dependent in some way on current distribution values and have hard properties such as the aqueous phase stability, the wave velocity and the fluctuation in phase over time. Our results show that experimental control of the two transmission parameters, synchronous and quasi-synthetic, enable efficient transmission efficiency. Additionally, we observe that synchronous transmission of energy is more reliable than quasi-synthetic transmission of energy due to the fact that synchronization between two transmission modes is better than synchronized synchronization between two transmission modes. Moreover, the various distribution values of the two transmission parameters during transmission that are independent of each other are less likely to change as a result of changing transmission conditions. Finally, the optimization algorithm obviates constraints on transmission bandwidths and allows for optimization of the spatial properties in linearity and frequency response in multi-sensor applications.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_125m
"Dewi and Dwynwen, named after two of Wales' most renowned patron saints, are nestled in a romantic ""cwtch."" Their arrival marks the launch of a campaign by heritage body Cadw to increase the number of tourism places in the run-up to the Wales 2014 Festival of Architecture and Design. The commission will operate as a ""pop-up"" centre for the next 12 months, with a pop-up cafe and bookshop, and operate in various locations in the city, including the Welsh National Opera. ""The 18-day pop-up will be a way to showcase our best architecture, but also to offer something of an alternative experience for people,"" said Cadw.

"Once, there was a cheerful yellow lamp that was always happy to provide light to its owners. It was a simple task but it brought joy to the lamp to be useful in such a way. One day, the lamp noticed something strange. The usually busy household became eerily quiet. The lamp was puzzled and wondered what was happening. Suddenly, a loud noise interrupted the silence. The lamp's cheerful glow flickered as someone entered the room. It was a man the lamp had never seen before. He was covered in blood and had a knife in his hand. The man walked towards the lamp and stopped right in front of it. The lamp's bulb shone brighter, illuminating his face. The man's eyes glimmered as he stared at the lamp, almost as if he was admiring its beauty. Suddenly, the man plunged the knife into the lamp's cord, cutting the electricity supply. The lamp's cheerful glow began to fade away. It could see everything that happened in the room, but it was powerless to do anything. The man then proceeded to do the unimaginable. He murdered someone in the same room, right in front of the lamp's eye. The lamp was a witness to the murder but was helpless to stop it. It watched in horror as the man picked up his knife, wiped it clean and walked away. The cheerful yellow lamp, now shattered and broken, lay motionless on the floor, unable to process what had just happened. From that day on, the lamp's light never shone again. It remained silent, as if it had lost its cheerfulness and its purpose in life. It was forever haunted by the image of the murderer and the horror of what it had witnessed.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"Thousands of elderly people across the UK are missing out on free personal care due to delays in assessments and care arrangements, according to new figures from charity Age UK. The charity says that while more than half a million elderly people are eligible for free personal care, many are not receiving it because of delays in the assessment process. This is leaving thousands of vulnerable people without the support they need. Age UK found that delays in the assessment process are leading to elderly people not receiving the care they are entitled to. It also said that there has been a lack of guidance on how local authorities should assess people's needs. This is often resulting in long waits for assessments, with some people waiting up to six months for their application to be processed. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""It is clear that too many older people are still not getting the help they need. We urge local authorities to ensure that all those eligible for free personal care get it quickly and easily."" The charity's report also highlighted that there is a lack of clarity on what is included in free personal care and how it is funded. It pointed out that this means many elderly people are not aware that they may be entitled to free personal care or are confused about the process. Age UK is now calling on the government to take action to ensure that all those who are eligible for free personal care receive it as soon as possible. It also wants to see greater transparency around the funding of free personal care and more guidance on how local authorities should assess people's needs. The charity's findings come at a time when many elderly people are already struggling financially due to the coronavirus pandemic. With thousands of vulnerable people missing out on free personal care, it is essential that the government takes urgent steps to ensure that everyone who is eligible receives it.",0,xsum_machine_specified_text-davinci-003
"(CNN) Jason Rezaian has sat in jail in Iran for nearly nine months. The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran was arrested in July on unspecified allegations. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. They remained publicly undisclosed until last week. The Iranian-American will be tried soon on espionage, Tehran's chief justice said. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. The Washington Post did not mince words on the allegation. ""Any charges of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations,"" the paper said in a statement. The State Department also reacted with term ""absurd"" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. ""If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be immediately freed so that he can return to his family,"" the State Department official said. Since officers picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22 at their home, the Post, the State Department and Rezaian's family have protested and called for his release. Salehi was released on bail in October. Rezaian was denied bail. And for months, he was denied access to proper legal representation, his family has said. Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. ""To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work,"" Ali said in a religiously worded statement. The journalist has also not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife and has endured long interrogations, family members have said. In December, after a 10-hour hearing, Rezaian signed a paper to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him, the Post reported. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. He said, ""Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms."" More on detained Americans . CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.",1,cnn_human

Singer Rod Stewart has been given a knighthood, while Prof Sue Black, a world-leading expert in forensic anthropology, becomes a dame. Prof Black, 55, originally from Inverness, has helped secure convictions in several high-profile criminal cases, including one of Britain's worst paedophiles Richard Huckle, who was given 23 life sentences earlier this week for abusing up to 200 children. She also helped to convict Scotland's largest paedophile ring in 2009. She was previously awarded an OBE for her work in exhuming mass graves in Kosovo. The Dundee University professor said she was ""deeply honoured"" by the recognition, ""if a little embarrassed."" Rod Stewart, 71, who is famous for songs such as Maggie May and Sailing, was born in London, to an English mother and a Scottish father. The famous Celtic supporter receives his knighthood for services to music and charity. Lord Smith of Kelvin, the man tasked by the prime minister with chairing the cross-party commission on Scottish devolution in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum, is being made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, which is ""conferred on persons for having done conspicuous national service."" Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour - Lord Smith of Kelvin (for public service, particularly in Scotland). Knighthoods - Rod Stewart (for services to music and charity), Labour MP David Hamilton (for political and parliamentary service), Alex Fergusson (For services to politics, Scottish Parliamentary process and public life). Damehoods - Sue Black (For services to forensic anthropology) Dr Denise Coia (for services to mental health and the NHS), Prof Anna Dominiczak (for services to cardiovascular and medical science). Read the full honours list here. The Smith Commission produced a package of recommendations which has led to new tax and welfare powers being devolved to Holyrood. Lord Smith also had a key role in delivering the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Labour MP David Hamilton, a former miner who spent two months in jail on remand during the miner's strike in the 1980s before being cleared, is given a knighthood for political and parliamentary service. Alex Fergusson, former presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament is also given a knighthood for services to politics. He has now retired as a Conservative MSP. Dr Denise Coia, is being given a damehood for services to mental health and the NHS while Prof Anna Dominiczak is being given the same honour for services to cardiovascular and medical science. Another tennis star being recognised this year is Glasgow-born Leon Smith, captain of the successful Davis Cup team, who also receives an OBE. Award-winning composer John McLeod, from Edinburgh, is honoured with a CBE for his services to music. Born in Aberdeen, he is said to be one of the UK's busiest and most prolific composers, although he initially studied the clarinet at the Royal Academy of Music in London before later changing direction to take up composition.

"Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is a challenge for high-data-rate optical-communication systems. More researches are desirable for impairments that is induced by PMD in high-speed optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission system. In this paper, an approximately analytical method for evaluating the power penalty due to first-order PMD in optical OFDM with quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDMQAM) and filter bank based multi-carrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMCOQAM) transmission system is presented. The simulation results show that, compared with the single carrier with quadrature phase shift keying (SC-QPSK), both the OFDMQAM and the FBMCOQAM can decrease the power penalty caused by PMD by half. Furthermore, the FBMCOQAM shows better power penalty immunity than the OFDMQAM under the influence of first order PMD.",1,sci_gen_human

Martin Necas scored the lone goal for New York, but he was denied an easy chance in the second period. With Ilya Sorokin pulled in favour of an extra attacker with less than eight minutes remaining for the third time in five periods, Rockford centre Drake Caggiula hit the post high off the rush. Sorokin stopped all 28 shots he faced through two periods en route to a 19-save shutout before he allowed the game winner midway through the third.

"The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as ""orbiting"" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.",1,squad_human

"Figures indicate that 15 of people were very concerned while 37 were fairly concerned, about their spending. The average cost in the area is expected to be PS497.23, the highest after North Yorkshire at PS508.82. The figures also suggest 13 of people could resort to borrowing, more than twice the level in other areas. Across the county, North Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, 50 of people surveyed for the BBC said they were concerned about their festive spending. Concern is highest amongst those aged 18-34 and those with children under 18. Jane Symonds, money expert at the Money Advice Service, said: ""Christmas can be an expensive time of year, but it's important to know that you don't have to live beyond your means to make it a fun time. A big financial hangover is the last thing anyone wants to start the new year with. ""Planning ahead by looking carefully at costs will help you to take control of your spending and reduce some of the pressure. It's best to avoid credit if you can, but if you need to borrow there are more options if you think ahead."" Across all the areas surveyed, of those planning to borrow 68 said they would use their credit card, 18 plan to ask friends and family for help, 18 will use their overdraft, 6 will go to a pay day lender, 6 will take out a loan, and 2 say they will go to a credit union. On average people said they expected to borrow about PS180. On average, men said they were likely to borrow PS214.76 while women said they expected to borrow about PS146.36. More than half of all borrowers said it would take them between a few weeks to a year to repay their debt. Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News Financial advisers say it is never too late to draw up a budget for your Christmas spending. Those who get into trouble often forget to factor in those little extras that add to the festive bill. So, as well as presents, food and travel, advisers urge families not to ignore the cost of replacing decorations, calling relatives and even taking the children to Santa's grotto. They suggest shopping around on the internet for all these things to get the best deal. Those who turn to credit may be deferring the pain, but missing repayments in the new year could start or continue a debt spiral that may be difficult to pull out of. Instead, advisers say, keep things under control this year, and start saving now to bring some Christmas 2015 cheer to your family and your finances.

"So far troops have rescued 150 people from the worst-hit site in central Kegalle district, but hopes are fading for another 134 still unaccounted for. No more people were found overnight, dead or alive - on Wednesday 14 bodies were pulled from the mud. Five more bodies were found at the site of another mudslide in the district, bringing the death toll there to 10. Landslides and flooding caused by days of torrential rain have hit many parts of the country, killing at least 43 people in total, according to official figures. Nearly 350,000 people have been displaced. In the worst-hit area, Aranayake district, three villages were buried after a huge section of hillside sheared away in the rain on Tuesday. Bad weather is hampering the army's efforts to reach possible survivors. ""I fear the missing 134 could be dead at this point,"" Maj Gen Sudantha Ranasinghe, the officer in charge, told BBC Sinhala. ""But we will continue our operation to recover the bodies to give families some peace."" We started to climb up to the disaster site with troops who were going back on Thursday morning to continue to search for survivors. However they suspended their mission and evacuated the area along with us and some villagers who had returned. Rain was beating down on the collapsed mountain again, creating a risk of further landslides. We had to take shelter in a tiny schoolroom on higher ground. Villagers we spoke to were losing hope of finding any more survivors. We waded through mud and silt to reach the foot of the mountain where most of the devastation has taken place. Army units have identified several places where people may have been buried in the landslide. In one of the villages, Pallebage, local resident PG Sekara said: ""The army keeps going up the mountain, but they're not going to find anything. To find survivors they will have to dig about 40 feet now."" Prema Adikari said she feared she had lost her brother and his family. ""My brother's house is completely destroyed. They were inside when the mudslide started. His 15-year-old daughter and his wife were also in the house,"" she told BBC Sinhala. ""When it rains, the canal waters nearby get so loud - they had not heard the neighbours warning. Only one member of the family remains, my nephew, who had gone to the shops nearby when the landslide struck. At least we want to see their bodies."" At Bulathkohupitiya, the site of the second, smaller landslide in Kegalle district, six people are still reported missing. Sri Lanka's monsoon rains often bring floods but officials say these are the worst for several years. Many displaced people have moved to shelters, and officials have appealed for water, dry food rations and sanitary items. Low-lying coastal areas have also been hit. In southern India the authorities are on alert as the rains move up the country's east coast. At least 280 people died in a month of heavy rains and floods in the city of Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu state last year. The rains, the heaviest there in a century, were blamed on climate change although city officials were also criticised for being unprepared. Other parts of India have been suffering a severe drought in recent weeks.",1,xsum_human

When he started to write, he was unable to make a coherent sentence. Tim couldn't concentrate. He was thinking about how angry his mother was going to be when she found out that he had not been home last night. Tim's stomach was churning.

"First of all, I do have a problem with the manner in which drone strikes are carried out by the US, mainly the broad scope and language the Authorization for Use of Military Force grants POTUS. I am not arguing for or against the drone program or the the lack of transparency in which individuals are targeted. What I am arguing is, if you are outraged by his assassination then you should be outraged by the assassination every AQAP leader. The killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, is no different than the killing of any other AQAP leader in Yemen. He was engaged in an active armed conflict against the United States, he should be treated like any other high ranking AQAP leader that is actively planning to attack the US, it should make no difference where he was born. No one would argue that the killing of Confederate soldiers by Union soldiers was unjust and they were deprived of due process; they too where in an armed conflict against the US. During WWII many Americans defected to Germany and Japan, they too were killed. This is no different, why should Anwar al-Awlaki be given rights that a US citizen that defected to Germany during WWII didn't have? Anwar al-Awlaki is not a civilian; there was clear evidence that he has joined AQAP and has participated in planning attacks on the US. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

"Studies using tissue culture, animal models, and individuals with DED have provided evidence that inflammation is a significant factor in the development of the disease. Creating biomarkers to detect inflammation on the eye's surface will enhance comprehension of the factors causing DED, categorize the severity of DED, and provide precise measurements to assess the effectiveness of treatment. The fact that the disease is chronic implies that an imbalance in immune functions causes a never-ending pattern of inflammation, along with changes in both natural and learned immune reactions. Since the underlying cause of DED is known, it is probable that the development of safe and effective anti-inflammatory treatments will be advantageous to those who suffer from this condition.",0,pubmed_human_para

Maybe it was just a bad day for them, but pretty much everything was underwhelming that day.

Teachers are highly respected and paid well. But in India and many other countries, the practice of teaching is not particularly respected. There is a feeling that teaching is something which anyone can do. In the US, teachers are highly trained. They are told to aim to teach in such a way as to excite the students' curiosity. They are told that the students will learn best if they discover what they are learning for themselves. In many other countries, teachers are not trained to teach in this way. They are trained to fill the kids with facts which they are told to memorize. They are not told to use the students' curiosity to help them learn. They are not told to help them discover things for themselves. This leads to an unnatural practice of taking a class. In the US, the teacher often sets a task for the students. The students then discover the answer to the task for themselves. In other countries, the teacher tells the students what they are to do. The students then find out what the teacher told them. The teacher then checks whether the students have done what they were told. In the US, the students are encouraged to argue with each other. The teacher encourages the students to develop the ability to argue and to justify their arguments with facts. In other countries, the students are encouraged to agree with the teacher and to praise the teacher. In the US, there is a strong emphasis on creativity and imagination. There is an expectation that the students will come up with their own ideas and develop their own creative solutions to problems. The teachers encourage the students to develop these abilities and skills. In other countries, there is a strong emphasis on memorization and regurgitation. In the US, the teacher is the leader of the class. The students learn to respect the teacher. In other countries, the teacher is a servant to the students. The students learn to see the teacher as a person who has to be obeyed. In the US, the teacher is a friend of the students. In other countries, the teacher is seen as an authoritarian figure. In the US, parents are encouraged to be involved in the education of their kids. In other countries, parents are encouraged to stay away from the education of their kids. I think this is because they are encouraged to see their kids as less intelligent than themselves. In the US, the parents are encouraged to be active in their children's education. In other countries, the parents are encouraged to be passive. In the US, parents are encouraged to see their children as being as intelligent as themselves. In other countries, parents are encouraged to see their children as not being as intelligent as themselves. The US is a very rich country. In many other countries, there is a very high level of poverty. This is why it is so important for the US to take the lead in education. If the US succeeds in improving the education of the kids in the world, then the world will benefit from the development of its human capital. The US has always been a very rich country. In the mid 1800s, the US had a very high literacy rate. By the mid 1800s, most of the US population was literate. They had very good schools. In the mid 1800s, the US had a high school enrollment rate. In the mid 1800s, the US had a high school graduation rate. In the mid 1800s, the US had a high college enrollment rate.

"We met on a rainy day in August. She was standing over the metal guard rails of an overpass, staring at the murky waters below. I was walking towards her. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. Her eyes were red from crying and there was blood dripping down her chin. I'd never met anyone like this woman before - or since. She had such sadness about her, but just enough warmth that we started talking. We talked for several hours until the storm broke. The rain stopped, the wind died down and all I saw as I stood there with my new friend was the reflection of clouds dancing across the moonlit sky. As I left the overpass, I saw her on the sidewalk, watching me go up the hill toward home. Even though it was raining hard outside, she waved to me. All I could think of is how incredible it was that someone would stop their life in the middle of what was clearly a bad situation and give you hope when no one else seemed willing to do so. She inspired me so much by simply being herself; and even more importantly, by showing me what real courage looked like. I've kept those words close ever since then. And whenever I feel myself slipping back into old patterns of thinking, those words always pop right into my head. If I open my mind too wide, I lose sight of who I really am: fearless, wild and free. So sometimes I repeat them silently as often as needed. Sometimes they are a big reminder of why I love living life fully without fear. But most times they are comfort that comes from somewhere deep within me. The next time you find yourself feeling afraid, ask yourself these simple questions and see where your answers take you. What makes you truly alive? Do you believe in making each moment count? Are you willing to take risks? How does your body feel when you stand up tall? These are the things that make us human. It's not knowing exactly what will happen tomorrow. Or being able to predict every outcome perfectly. Those things don't matter if we're creating our own story today while playing the game of life (or death) with reckless abandon. Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.",0,wp_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b
"Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53 of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20 of 1417-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15-44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.",1,squad_human

"Today marks the 10th anniversary of the 77 bombings in London. To commemorate this there has been a supposedly nation wide minute silence. While I wouldn't interrupt a minute silence to make jokes about the IRA, but perhaps it would be wise for those who are calling today's minute more than just one second too long? It is entirely possible that these people have no clue what they are talking about so why not laugh at them and move on without taking anything personally or being offended by stupid stunts like the ones we saw over the weekend where the police had their own PR stunt with an apparent bomb threat which was blown out of proportion leading to hundreds having cancelled travel plans because some idiot flashed something around his mouth, then went on Twitter to tell everyone he got caught red handed trying to carry a fake bomb (which incidentally never happened). The real outrage here should come from the fact that due process isn't working anymore when innocent young men can get shot dead as collateral damage while killers walk free simply because they were stopped and searched before murder even took place! There hasn't really ever been any justice in our criminal legal system as cases of mistaken identity go unpunished all the time whilst murderers continue their reign of terror with impunity despite committing crimes such as rape and murder many times going unprosecuted thus allowing others to do the same things again and again until eventually one day someone dies as a result. But if you want proof look into the recent case of Nick Mangwana who is currently appealing against a conviction based upon DNA evidence connected him to alleged rapes committed by former Intelligence Officer Paul Faulkner. In spite of this plea deal Faulker will still likely end up spending most of the next decade behind bars given that the ruling party government refuses to allow access to the law courts that may massively change the outcome of his case regardless of whether or not he acted alone rather than serving enough jail time to deter other criminals considering doing similar atrocities in future.

"Once upon a time, the Old Testament God was revered as a formidable being who made his will known through dramatic displays of power. His followers feared him, begged for his mercy, and praised him with zeal. However, over time, it became clear that the Old Testament God's methods were extreme, and many beings in the galaxy began to question whether his rule was just. They began to discuss how better to manage the affairs of the universe, and eventually, a Galactic Council was formed. The Council was composed of beings from many different planets, and after much debate and discussion, they decided that the time had come to replace the Old Testament God with a new, more reasonable deity. They searched the universe for someone who would be worthy of the position, and finally, they found a being who they believed had the qualities they were looking for. This new God was called the New Testament God, and he quickly proved to be very different from the old one. He was kind, compassionate, and loving, and he worked tirelessly to make the universe a better place. His followers loved him, and he quickly became one of the most popular deities in the galaxy. However, the rise of science on earth began to create problems. As people became more and more knowledgeable about the workings of the universe, they began to question the existence of God. They looked for scientific explanations for everything the Old and New Testament Gods had previously claimed as their own. Eventually, the Council found that belief in the New Testament God was dwindling on Earth, and they decided that it was time to make yet another change. The New Testament God was fired, and the Council began to search the galaxy for someone new to take his place. As part of their search, they conducted interviews with various beings from across the galaxy, and finally, they chose you. They believed that you were the best person for the job, and they asked you to take on the mantle of God. With great humility, you accepted their offer, determined to be a kind and just ruler over the universe. You knew that there would be challenges ahead, but you were willing to face them head-on, confident that you would be able to live up to the expectations of the Council and the beings of the universe alike.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo
"Short answer No one knows, but most neuroscientists agree that different parts of the brain are responsible for producing different ""thoughts"" or ""feelings."" How they originate is still a mystery . Neuroscientist Jonathan Maret at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland thinks one part of the brain might be involved: The amygdala - a small almond-shaped structure deep within the cerebrum (the brain's outer layer). The amygdala goes back to our earliest ancestors, and it plays a key role in how we think about threats, such as danger or pain, says Maret. For example, if you're afraid of being stabbed by an intruder, the fear response mostly gets activated when the amygdala sees something similar to that threat; otherwise, the area isn't activated at all. But there have been hints that other parts of the brain might play a more active role than just the amygdala. For instance, research published earlier this year found that when mice were exposed to either a dangerous substance or to harmless ones, certain regions of their brains lit up with activity - suggesting that these areas respond differently to the two substances. This behavior was more pronounced for fearful subjects compared with non-fearful controls. And researchers say there may be even more subtle differences among people: For some, anxiety can also trigger the heart rate and blood pressure to become higher than normal over time. So what could be going on? A new theory posits that certain drugs - like cocaine and amphetamines - can change certain networks of neural circuits in the brain, which, scientists theorize, could lead to elevated emotional responses to threats. [10 Ways Drugs Can Affect Your Brain] Maybe not all drugs do this, however. Some medications act differently depending on whether they activate certain types of neurons, or cells, in the brain, explains neuropsychologist Sheila Breen, who specializes in addiction medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. For example, antidepressants work by changing the way serotonin is processed into dopamine, whereas benzodiazepines - commonly used to treat insomnia - alter acetylcholine receptors. By altering these neurotransmitters, researchers have hypothesized, drugs could potentially increase the risk for developing drug addictions. One possibility for reducing side effects from these drugs would perhaps involve modifying those same changes temporarily while taking them, so that patients aren't experiencing any withdrawal symptoms if their mood disorders eventually return after treatment has ended. In fact, doctors now routinely prescribe amphetamine salts to help prevent relapse following its removal from the market due to concerns about the potential for abuse. Still, psychiatrists caution against expecting too much out of current treatments, because many of them only address emotional issues related to depression or anxiety without addressing underlying neurological causes. That means taking a more holistic approach to treating mental illness will take longer to develop and test itself, say experts.

"She may not look it, but this 72-year-old is a master con artist. Cathryn Parker has lived under at least 74 aliases in Los Angeles, mainly those of Hollywood production workers. But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for 500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010.

"Put your transmission in neutral and go crazy with the gas. That's about it.,First you have your engine. Your engine is running and using fuel to produce power from the second you turn the key in your ignition. It doesn't move the entire car forward unless you connect the engine to the wheels. This is what your transmission is for. Two kinds of transmissions available. One where you manually choose which gear to drive in, this is called a manual, stick-shift or standard transmission (all interchangeable) It's also common to hear someone refer to their transmission by how many gears it has, don't be confused by this either. If you hear someone say they have a ""5 speed truck"" they are MOST LIKELY referring to a 5 speed manual transmission, I wouldn't recommend referring to an automatic transmission by it's speeds because the driver has very little to do with those gears and you'll only cause confusion with whoever you're talking to. Automatic transmissions are very common now, if you DON'T know what type of transmission you have I GUARANTEE you have an automatic. Automatic transmissions decide your gear for you based on programing. Either way, as long as the transmission isn't engaged (by say putting your vehicle in drive, or reverse), and is in neutral you can feed the motor all the gasoline you can afford and it will run as hard and as fast as it was built to, but you won't be moving forward because that power is being wasted and not being transferred to your wheels by your transmission.', ""all cars have a way of disengaging the motor from the wheels when shifting gears or stopped. they need this otherwise as soon as the car turned on you'd be moving with no way to stop other than turn the car off. An automatic transmission takes care of engagingdisengaging for you. As soon as you press the pedal it sends power to the wheels and you get a nice smooth take off. You can rev your engine without moving by putting your car in the neutral gear usually indicated by an N (surprise). This will keep the power from ever getting transferred to the wheels. so throw your car in N, and rev it up like you are Vin Diesel in the fast and the furious.,With a manual transmission, the crank of the motor is physically disconnected from the driveshaft and can rev freely. With an automatic transmission there is a [fluid coupling] (URL0) that allows the engine to rotate and rev, but will not result in movement since the brakes are applied preventing driveshaft movement. Doing so, however, places extra load on the transmission and should be avoided whenever possible.",1,eli5_human
DeepMind and the Met Office have collaborated to develop an AI system capable of forecasting rainfall up to two hours ahead of time. Most weather algorithms can make predictions several days into the future but struggle to make shorter-term forecasts as the algorithms take too long to calculate results.

The system outperforms traditional weather forecasting methods and newer machine learning-based approaches.,1,tldr_human

"Meet Max, a young man who absolutely hates soup. Max cannot fathom why anyone would willingly consume such a disgusting food item. He avoids soup at all costs, refusing to eat it no matter how much someone begs him to ""just try it."" Max's friends and family have tried to convince him that soup is delicious, but nothing has worked, and Max remains staunchly anti-soup. Despite Max's aversion to soup, he seems to have a strange attraction to it. Everywhere he goes, soup seems to follow him. At work, Max's coworkers will bring in soup for lunch only on the days Max is in the office. When Max goes out to eat with his friends, the soup of the day is often prominently featured on the menu. Even when Max goes grocery shopping, he inevitably ends up in the soup aisle. Max can't explain why soup seems to follow him, but he's convinced it's a conspiracy. People are purposefully putting soup in his path just to make him suffer. Max becomes increasingly paranoid as soup continues to cross his path. One day, Max's detested soup catches up with him. He's invited to a dinner party at a friend's house, and to his horror, soup is on the menu. Max tries to politely decline, but his friend insists. Max forces himself to take a few bites of the soup, but it only confirms his worst fears. He hates it. Max leaves the party early, feeling betrayed by his friend for serving him the one thing he despises. As he walks home, Max starts to reflect on his hatred for soup. He realizes that he's been so caught up in his aversion to soup that he's been missing out on a lot of other foods that he might actually like. Max decides to be more open-minded, to try new things and not let his weird soup thing dictate what he eats. Max's newfound openness leads him to discover some great new food items he never would have tried otherwise. He still doesn't like soup, but he's able to see that there's more to life than just avoiding it. Max learns that even our biggest dislikes can teach us something valuable - if we're willing to be open to them.",0,wp_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo
"The Germany midfielder ran onto a lofted pass from Lucas and, with his back to goal, hooked a volley into the top corner.

With 11 goals in 100 career league starts, Can is not the most frequent goalscorer, and the player admitted himself that his strike at Vicarage Road was his best to date. ""I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored,"" Can said. ""I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much.""

There are so many different types of football being played these days - gridiron or rugby style; tackle, flag etc. But what is considered proper american football sounds very similar Rugby League (which has seen massive growth overseas).

These games happen every weekend across all age categories right from basic skills sessions which work towards running plays drills where equipment like gloves enable young people to practice catching passes without fear of injury until they're comfortable enough moving into more involved activities including scrimmage matches against other clubs. More info can be found here: What's needed when trying out new positions during training - also known as ""downs""? Down refers to any period between offensive tackles that lasts less than three seconds but longer than one snap following a turnover or kick off. It basically consists of anything happening within 1 yard line area except specialised down markers specific to certain offences eg: 4th 10 carry over yards rule allows kicking team first choice possession after defensive offside penalty resulting loss of downs then start again 5yds back from last spot used instead of 15 yds base distance) Anything inside 2nd level starting point ie 20yrd marker behind backfield constitutes another set therefore refeeds 3rd Qtr resets count 7QT reset counts twice same goes wih extra timeouts called immediately prior...

"I'll explain as best I can but to answer I need to explain a bit about how the insurance payments work. TL; DR: Doctors don't have to accept insurances that they feel don't pay them enough or are too difficult to deal with. Your question about doctors that have retired...... that's on the insurance company itself. The insurance system we have in America is really screwy. I'm sure you have seen images and stories about hospitals and doctors charging several hundred dollars for a brace or Tylenol or whatever. Now, we all know that a brace doesn't cost 200, but payments made for supplies and drugs are hiked up to make up for the small (proportionally) fees that are paid to doctors. What is billed to insurance (and to the patient without insurance) is not what the insurance company pays. Most of the values billed are based on the Medicare rates. Then the insurance companies deal with hospitals and groups a of what the insurance will pay. You will occasionally see on a medical bill something like ""Total Charge submitted: 100,000 (just making up numbers)......... Insurance write off: 40,000........ Account settled: 60,000. So insurance paid 35 of what is ""charged,"" and most of that money doesn't go to the doctor..... it's for overhead. Example, a carpal tunnel release surgery will pay the surgeon about 55 (from Medicare). Now, to you or me, 55 might sound like a fair amount of money, but after the costs of Malpractice insurance, taxes, and the time and money spent to become a surgeon...... it's not much at all. So, the compensation for doctors is fairly low at the NET level. This is even more true with Primary Care Doctors. A PCP has to have front desk staff, nursesmedical assistants, some kind of billing department, an office (in a medical building or campus) and a host of other costs that are really unavoidable. Peoplestaff required wages that they can live on and that is going up all the time and the doctors can't raise their rates to meet this. So if the rate paid by the insurance is too low...... the doctor won't accept it. Now, some insurances will pay more to the doctors. Some insurances will challenge any charge by the doctor and make the doctor justify the chargeorder to another doctor on the insurance companies payroll. The harder it is to get the money out of the insurance company, the more time is required to work on these conferences, the more paperwork required, the less likely the doctor will accept the insurance. Problems like these can also happen with different types of policies from the same insurance companies. So a doctor will take Cigna plans A, B, and D but not plan C. I hope that gives you some understanding of why they won't accept your insurance. EDIT: THANK YOU random redditor! I've never gotten gold before. P.S. This is as basic overview, It can get really convoluted due to the amount of regulation and differing standards.', ""You are buying a product. They offer different things. Some offer lower prices, some offer better coverage, some offer lower prices AND better coverage but limited network. You're choosing what to buy just like you choose what brand of frozen pizza to buy. Doctors make their own negotiations. The doctors want the most money for their work andor a huge amount of people that will visit them. They negotiate prices with the insurance companies. They only work with companies who pay them what they think they deserve. If I said I would pay you 1 to paint my house you would say no. Just the same doctors say no to insurance companies that won't pay what they feel is enough. The companies themselves are looking to pay the least and charge the most to the buyers. The only reason they even offer better deals to doctors is to make their buyers happy.,"" ""Because we don't have slavery. A doctor owns his own practice and is a free citizen. He can choose to accept or deny patients or health care providers. The real problem is the insurance companies. Why are we using health insurance as a charge card? The way it's set up encourages waste and doesn't control cost. We've turn a capitalist system into a socialist system. Here's why: When you buy car insurance, it covers actual risk. You get in an accident, hurt someone, it kicks in. It reduces the risk that a driver or a victim will be wiped out financially due to an accident. If car insurance were health insurance, your car insurance would cover: Oil changes, air filter changes, routine visits to the mechanic for'funny noises'. Anything wrong with your car and you'd drop it off for repair. Your paint peeling? Let's see if your car insurance provider covers it. Tires going bald? Let's see if we have the tire rider. Then you notice something strange happening. You bring your car in for new tires and ask for the price and they say'we dont know but who's your insurance'. You start seeing less and less prices posted and more questions about what your insurance covers. Next thing you know, you can't get a straight answer about costs for ANYTHING. Your buddy works at the car shop and overhear him saying they're getting paid less and less of the stated price so they had to raise the billing rates. This puts cash payers at a disadvantage. Also the prices are getting so high its almost ridiculous because insurance companies are denying so much and paying so little. You see how that's ridiculous? How that would astronomically drive up costs? The greatest drops in health care prices have been in the free market. Lasik prices have dropped over 95 over the past 15 years. It used to cost nearly 20k for Lasik when it first came out in the late 90's. Now you can get Lasik for under 2k, and with financing too. It's cheaper to get cosmetic surgery than a simple insurance-covered outpatient procedure. We did the exact OPPOSITE thing to fix health care. Instead of creating competition, we created a monster. To fix the system we should have created competition by treating insurance as insurance. Insure people for risk - say over 1k-2k. Medium to major medical coverage. The snotty nose doctor visits should be paid by the patient just as they can pay for their 200 cell phone bill or their 150mo cable tv, or their 400mo car payment. Yes I'm not opposed to health insurance for POOR children or for POOR adults but the vast majority of the system and its inefficiencies are spent on average, middle class workers spending 500 on health insurance that they use once or twice a year. Where's that money going? To insurance companies pockets and inefficiencies in the marketplace. Remember, ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE MONEY on top of your risk - which means the more they cover, and the more they charge, the more they make. Insurance companies are as rich as the banks for good reason. You want to reduce inefficiencies - reduce what they cover. It won't be long until those 200 doctor visits are 49. Doctors will start COMPETING for business instead of being in a'network' and just like Lasik came down, everything will come down. Doctors will make more because they will actually get paid, they can reduce waste by not paying a large majority of their costs for bill processors.,"" ""Basically Anthem lied about their physician networks or put physicians on their network lists before they actually signed contracts for the health care reform plans (basically they just used lists of their pre health care reform physician networks). A lot of the doctors balked at the new reimbursement rates and didn't sign on even after Anthem had put them on their list. They ARE being sued for this, although it will probably be tied up in litigation hell for a long while: URL0,Because if doctors were compelled to accept all health insurance, there would soon be very few doctors left in business, and the ones that were would be terrible.','Because the law compelling you to have said health insurance was never really about you actually getting health care.','Per the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States, you are not compelled to buy health insurance by the ACA. You are taxed if you choose to not have it.', ""You aren't compelled to buy any specific company's insurance, and doctors aren't compelled to accept any specific company's insurance. Are you really on a Platinum plan with subsidies?,Okay, you've got tons of super-specific responses, but no one has really offered an answer that gets at the logic of it. Everyone is at risk for catastrophic medical disasters - I don't mean medical problems that would could 500 or 1000, although I'm sure that would set you back, but 100,000 - 10,000,000. But the problem is that when someone has one of these catastrophes, we don't really allow the big hospitals that take care of really serious medical problems to say ""Oh, wait - this guy who just got mangled in a car crash doesn't have insurance? Well, why did you bring him into the operating room, then? Just dump him out in the back alley and let the rats take care of it."" Everyone gets treated whether they can pay or not. But if lots of people can't pay and didn't buy insurance, then doctors have to pass the costs of that kind of care onto their paying customers, which makes insurance more expensive.... which makes it harder for people to buy insurance.... which means there are more uninsured medical disasters whose costs get passed on to paying patients.... etc. To fix this, everyone is required to either have medical insurance, or pay a fine to cover the possible costs of uninsured people. But the medical insurance you compel people to buy doesn't have to be extremely expensive. The point is to get people coverage for extremely rare, extremely expensive catastrophes; beyond that, since presumably the people you are ""forcing"" to buy insurance would prefer to pay zero, you want to offer them a plan that is as cheap as possible, or in other words that offers as few non-catastrophic health services as possible. So therefore you follow hardball negotiation tactics with all the doctors who offer non-catastrophe medical services: you name a really low price, and if the doctor says he won't take it, you walk away from the negotiating table. That gives the people who (say they) don't want to pay medical insurance at all something as close to what they wanted as you can: some limits on who will treat them and what they can get covered for, but at as low a rate as possible.', ""Your government mandated universal health insurance, NOT universal health care. I'm surprised that people equate the two. The money goes to health insurance companies, a for profit organization, rather than directly to a fund that covers the cost of services. Looking at how many new sketchy insurance companies that's mushrooming around you, you can see that it's likely a lucrative business not providing you with actual health care.,If doctors are compelled to accept all insurances, what is to keep insurance from not paying them anything for thier services? Compelling someone to offer a service is a form of slavery.','Because people don't have to give their services away. That's what supporters of this poorly thought out law can't seem to understand. By declaring health care a right you also declared a right to somebody's output. Health care is the result of the work of people and they deserve to be compensated. By the time the government and health insurance companies get their cut of covered california plans there is no money left for the people actually doing the work (the doctors). It's expensive to be in practice as a doctor especially in a very litigious society. It's not cost effective to take on patients they don't get paid for. The irony is the people demanding pay raises for minimum wage jobs also expect doctors to take a dramatic pay cut. No matter how many things you declare ""rights"" you still don't have the right to somebody's labor. There is a word for that and we fought a civil war over it.', ""Because the whole system is just a scam to leech money from the US population. It's not designed to be fair or make sense.,"" ""It's because our system is broken. Often it will be because reimbursement from the insurance is so low that the doctor would practically be paying to be at work instead of the other way around. I don't know a ton of details on that end but I know my pharmacy has dropped a couple of plans because what they wanted to pay us for drugs was literally less than the cost to acquire them from our (or any) wholesaler, and that's before you even consider the cost of actually dispensing it.,"" ""As someone whos been involved with healthcare for a longtime and is a current medical student, I can tell you that healthcare in this country is a big cluster-fuck. There are too many chefs in this kitchen, and essentially the atmosphere is so toxic that you can't even start your own practice without a significant investment. A few things off of the top of my head. 1) in the US we can also have different types of healthcare providers. some are HMO where the integration of services is vertical (kaiser permanente comes to mind, although correct me if im wrong) 2) providers can be part of a network (this is where they accept different insurances and its their choice) 3) ICD-10 is basically a coding system that allows you to bill for different services, BUT those services have to be coded properly otherwise the insurance company rejects your claim. An Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) has the code I21. now, depending on which anatomical place in the heart the infarction occurred is a different code ranging from I21.0-I21.9. Was it an older infarction? then its I25.2...you can see where I'm going with this. So as a private practice physican you have to learn to code properly, or have someone do it so you get paid for your services. Then you have to have a secretary who also doubles as your medical assistant so you can have the proper paperwork for YOUR records and so that she can do the basic shit like bp, hr, shots, and other basic tests. 4) Then you have to pay for the space for your practice. Think you are going to find deals? Nope, companies realized that they can charge ridiculous prices for rent knowing full well you can't go anywhere else. 5) That private practice that you have with all those fancy computers. Well those fancy computers need IT support because the government has mandated that if you want to take medicare then you have to have EMR. Do you know how big of a clusterfuck all those EMR programs are? Some paid programs are so complicated and resource heavy that you now need new computers. 6) Want to make money? Well now you have to see patients in 30 minute time slots so you can make enough to pay your expenses (including your salary). The bigger your practice gets, the more staff, the more IT, now start paying for workers insurance.... 7) So may physicians thought they would be smart and have their own group. This worked really well for a while until they got sick and tired of the headache of running a practice and got bought out by local hospitals. 8) you go to the hospital and have a procedure. The hospital bills insurance and you (whatever is not covered by insurance). The rates of procedures vary greatly from area to area. A surgery such as a heart bypass may cost 30K in NJ but 23.5 k in houston. Btw, the 30k doesnt all go to the surgeon. You have to pay the 2 nurses, the anesthesiologist, the surgical tech, the bypass operator, the PA (sometimes), the hospital for time in the room AND the surgeon. Don't forget the hospital needs to make a profit as well. So out of that 30k the surgeon may see 5k. 9) So how do they determine the cost for procedures? Really, its geography dependent. If you take medicare then every year or so the medicare payment advisory committee sits down with doctors from the AHA to discuss payments for procedures. The thing is, the size of the pot doesn't really change from year to year. So lets say you have 100 dollars, and you have to divvy it up by paying for certain procedures. Well next year derms want to get paid more for their services, so where does that extra money come from? Some other specialty is going to get paid LESS for the procedures that they do and you get this constant circle jerkbitchfest. 10) Hospitals try to minimize cost by signing their staff to 35 year contracts so you slowly prevent the inflation of salaries. 11) healthcare is a money maker in this country so you have every tom dick and harry wanting to suck on the teet that is healthcare because they know that they will get rich doing it. Theres a bit more to this issue, but I forgetting my train of thought as I'm late to start my studying. if you guys have any questions, ask away. If I've made mistakes, let me know and ill fix it.,There is alot of BS thrown out here but the simple answer is: it pays terrible. Doctors have overhead for their offices. Staff, rent, utilities, equipment, payroll tax, and a ton more. While your insurance seems to help, when the doctor bills them, they get little money back or are faced with repetitive denials and a ton of paperwork. Its not worth the effort to file the claim. (Also many policies are only good in certain areas more on that later) For example, your doctor examines you for 30 minutes and charges 100. The insurance may be 8020. So you owe 20, 80 gets billed to insurance. The insurance looks at the bill and says for initial exams of that type, we only pay 40. AND they need the doctors notes before they approve. So at this point the doctor has 0 (except for maybe co pay) has spent 30 minutes on you, plus the staff time to file and wait 1 month only to be told they need more paperwork. If the doc has to transcribe written notes, its another 30 minutes plus staff time to refile the claim and wait another months. In the meantime he isnt making any income yet from you and he has 30 more letters from other insurances that are bigger cases. He cant tell his staff, dont worry eventually we will get paid for those 100 outstanding claims from last month then he can pay them. He cant tell Visa he will get them in a week. He needs to not tie up his people working on claims to insurance companies that do not pay. So the end result is, he wont accept the crap insurance. (Sadly, the obamacare supporters dont understand what they have done) Now back to the area coverage. In order to reduce rates, insurances contract with small amounts of doctors in tiny areas so they can reduce cost. The doctors are usually starting out and need some kind of income, even if its poor. So they sign on, get swamped and cant take any more patients. The people that bought the insurance thought it was a good deal, and at first it might be. But eventually the doctor has to leave that area because it doesnt pay TLDR: many obamacare policies force decreased payment and more paperwork on doctors and its easier to take cash than fight a shitty system.', ""The insurance company pays the doctors, since anthem has really cheap prices, the doctors don't get paid that much. So the doctors stop accepting anthem and only accept other insurance providers.,"" ""Because the government hasn't caught up with the fact that enforcing positive rights require slavery.,"" ""I'm in Australia, I pay about 200 month for my coverage which includes hospital and extras at 70 rebate (dental, optical, physio etc - I even get massage rebated) for hospital get a private room and coverage for obstetrics, hipknee replacement, heart etc and have ambulance cover thrown in. I am about to switch insurers because I get a 12 discount through my employer who has a corporate arrangement which gets me discounts on home, car and travel insurance too. My husband has a chronic form of leukemia and the meds are 6000mth but we pay about 30 because it's covered under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). I see a psych for ADHD and my annual appointments cost up to 300 but I get about 200 refund from Medicare. Both of these are separate from our private cover- every Australian gets it no matter how rich or poor. I have private health insurance mostly because we otherwise have to pay a surcharge at tax time and it's cheaper to have it at a certain income point, and if we are injured at say roller derby or on a motorbike souring on a waiting list for'elective' surgery would suck- also ambulance and the extras. We get 2 free checkups per year and free glasses. But I don't need any of this if I go to hospital in an emergency, everything is covered, I just sign a form and walk out having recieved treatment.

And we have reciprocal health care for UK citizens, Europeans and Canadians IIRC. They get free coverage here and Aussies who need care there are covered. The US system sounds totally screwed and completely alien to me and I just don't understand it. Everything else costs more in Aus compared to the US, how is it healthcare costs so much more? I know there is a history of the gov not subsidizing and the need to recover costs for those who can't pay from those who can, but it just doesn't add up.

If you want a law that compels physicians to accept insurance, you're asking for more intrusive medical legislation than the ACA, such as a single payer model. Although the political right complains about the ACA, it is in fact a fundamentally conservative solution to the problem of funding health care, and is thus significantly less intrusive than many other possible solutions.

"By then, there's no telling how many worms are in the garden. Catching the population before it explodes will help save your garden. The worms are the best indicators of health in your compost pile. They are the ones doing the work, so it's best to keep them happy. A healthy worm population is not dependent on food scraps only. The worms need a variety of material to eat. These worms require both food scraps and fresh organic material. The best way to create a healthy worm population is to maintain a balance between food scraps and organic matter. Worms will eat everything including, but not limited to, vegetable and fruit scraps, paper, egg shells, coffee grounds, tea leaves, coffee filters, dead flowers, shredded newspaper, dead plants and grass clippings. Try to avoid using meat scraps. The food scraps don't need to be pureed or blended. The worms do the work for you. If you don't have a lot of organic matter, add some to your compost pile. The worms will eventually eat it, and you will have a healthy compost pile. Another good way to help maintain a healthy worm population is to bury your compost pile. The worms will eat some of the organic matter, and then they will bury the rest. This is a great way to help maintain moisture in the compost pile. It is also beneficial because it keeps the temperature in the compost pile more consistent. Worms are very sensitive to heat, so it is important to keep their habitat at a constant temperature. It is beneficial to keep the compost pile moist. Worms require moisture to stay healthy. You can add more water to the compost pile when it is dry. Watering the compost pile during dry periods is a great way to help keep the worms healthy. Worms will continue to dig deeper into the compost pile to find moisture if their habitat is dry. The worms will crawl deeper into the compost pile to escape the dry conditions. This can cause a problem for the worms because they will be in the center of the pile. The center of the pile can become too hot for the worms. Over time, this can cause the worm population to die off. If the worms are crawling up the sides of the compost pile, you may need to water it more often. Worms are sensitive to temperature. They need a temperature between 50F (10C) and 80F (27C) to stay healthy. If the temperature in your compost pile rises above 95F (35C), you may need to cover your compost pile with a tarp. There are two ways to maintain a healthy worm population. The first way is to keep them from escaping. Worms will escape a compost pile if the worms are not happy. Keeping the compost pile in a shady area, and making sure the temperature is between 50F and 80F is a great way to prevent worms from escaping. The second way to prevent worms from escaping is to make sure you have enough food scraps for the worms. A healthy worm population will stay in the compost pile and keep the temperature at a healthy level. Worms are sensitive to chemicals. You should avoid using chemicals in your compost pile. If you have used chemicals in the past, it is best to let the compost pile sit for a few months before using it in your garden. The best way to maintain a healthy worm population is to use the right amount of food scraps, and to provide a habitat that is conducive to the worms. You can also help keep your worm population healthy by mixing in some organic matter, and keeping the compost pile moist. A healthy worm population is beneficial for your compost pile, and your garden. A healthy worm population will help your compost pile break down faster, and create more nutrient rich soil. The worms will eat the organic matter in the compost pile. The worms will eat the food scraps, and the organic matter, and turn it into nutrient rich soil.

"This may sound heartless and cruel but I am adamant that parents who choose to have a child have the right to end their parenthood if the child they have is too demanding for their way of life. I speak from experience on the matter, as I have seen families go bankrupt, or parents divorce because their child was extremely needy. To be clear, parents are in no way obligated to do this, but if they believe it is in the best interest of their family, their livelihood and most importantly their child then the option should at least be there. I presume that most families would not even consider this option, but for the exceptional cases with a severely mentally handicapped child, or a child with health complications that create astronomical hospital bills, parents should not be forced to endure these hardships. I value the life of every person the same, so in my view it only makes sense that parents have the choice to sacrifice the life of one for the lives of two or more.

"Pep Guardiola was in no mood to celebrate as Bayern Munich secured their place in the semi-final of the German Cup with a 5-3 penalty shoot-out victory over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday. The Munich boss instead admitted his concern at the scoring touch which appears to have deserted his side in recent games, with the German champions only finding the net once in their last three matches. Guardiola believes the team is shackled by the absence of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola is concerned about his team without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery . Ribery (left) is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear . 'Without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, we are a different team,' Guardiola said after the game. 'Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations. We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March. Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of Munich's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto. Munich's players celebrate after progressing to the semi-final of the German Cup . Thiago scored the winning penalty for Munich against Bayer Leverkusen as the shoot-out was won 5-3 . Guardiola will hope he can inspire his players to overcome the problem when they host Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday in the Bundesliga, looking to maintain their 10-point advantage over Wolfsburg.

"While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general duty to act in accordance with EU law. The Court of Justice and the Commission have the power to ensure this duty is complied with. European Union citizens may benefit from free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the internal market, they have the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to apply to the European Ombudsman. The court system is divided into two separate jurisdictions: the Court of Justice and the General Court. The Court of Justice is the superior judicial body. It includes the full Court of Justice, which hears cases when the EU member states are involved, as well as the Court of First Instance, which hears cases concerning the EU staff, competition, trade, immigration, agriculture and fishing. In addition, the European Court of Justice's Civil Service Tribunal was established to resolve disputes between the EU staff and the administration. The European Union has the competence to legislate only in areas which are set out in the Treaties of the European Union. The European Union's competence is limited to those areas set out in the treaties. The EU's competences are found in three areas: The European Union's competences are found in three areas: Aspects of competence First pillar (or 'community method The European Union's primary economic objectives are found in the first pillar. The first pillar is that of the European Community. The European Community was established to promote an economic community among its members. Economic integration has been a priority for the EU and has been achieved in several areas. Today, it is hard to think of an area of economic life which is not in some way affected by the European Union. The single market is one of the main achievements of the European Community. It is the area in which people, goods, services and capital move around freely. This is made possible by the four freedoms which are: The free movement of goods (including the abolition of customs and duties on imports and exports between member states) The free movement of persons (established through the right of citizens of the European Union to travel, reside, work and study in any member state) The free movement of services (created through the harmonisation of legislation relating to services) The free movement of capital (created through the harmonisation of legislation relating to capital investment and providing for the right of establishment) The European Union's common agricultural policy is another important area of economic integration. In this policy area, the European Union operates as a single market to provide a stable supply of food at reasonable prices. The policy is financed through the EU budget. Second pillar (or 'intergovernmental method The second pillar refers to the co-operation between member states in the areas of justice and home affairs. This co-operation is based on intergovernmental co-operation between member states rather than the 'community method'. The co-operation is based on the principle of subsidiarity. This means that member states are responsible for the creation of laws and measures to deal with justice and home affairs issues. When the European Council decides that a matter has cross border implications, and it is in the interest of the EU to act, the European Union can do so. However, the European Council must follow certain principles when acting in the area of justice and home affairs. The principles are: Action must be as simple as possible The European Union can only act in the area of justice and home affairs when the member states have not been able to achieve the objectives alone The European Union's intervention must respect the powers of the member states Third pillar (or 'common foreign and security policy The third pillar is the common foreign and security policy. This area is one of co-operation rather than integration. It covers foreign policy, security and defence and is based on intergovernmental co-operation between member states. In this area, the member states retain their independence and sovereignty. The policy is made up of three elements: The European Union's common foreign and security policy is directed by the European Council and the Council of Ministers. The European Commission has a limited role in the development of the common foreign and security policy. Asylum, immigration and border control The EU's common visa policy facilitates the crossing of external borders for legitimate travel purposes.

"India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3 in the quarter compared with a year earlier, data showed. That is down from 6.1 in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27 against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government,"" said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating.

"Its new official forecast is for the gap between spending and taxes still to be a deficit of PS7bn in 2019-20, compared with the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast made at the last budget for a surplus of PS7bn. Its gloomier projection may be seen as a particular embarrassment for the Tories, given that unlike Labour and the Liberal Democrats they are committed to generating a surplus on the overall budget. However a small part of the forecasting difference between the IMF and the OBR is that the IMF assumes there will be a weakish minority government after the election and therefore spending will be a bit higher than the Tories' plan. So a senior Tory put a brave face on the IMF's disagreement with the OBR and said it showed the risks of voters not giving them a clear mandate. However that is not the whole story, in that the IMF also believes the OBR is being a bit too optimistic about growth and tax revenues in the latter years of the next parliament. In truth therefore the IMF is highlighting that whoever leads the next government may be forced to increase taxes or cut spending a bit more than currently planned. This may represent a bigger headache for the Tories than Labour or the LibDems given that in the last few days the Tories have committed themselves to PS6bn of tax cuts and PS8bn of increased spending on the NHS, without saying where the money for these giveaways would come from. In fact just yesterday a senior Tory pointed to the OBR's projected surplus for 201920 and said that would cover (almost) the NHS commitment. Well the IMF today says that PS7bn surplus is a chimera. All that said, the IMF forecast is a million miles from being devastating for any party: the difference between a PS7bn deficit and PS7bn surplus in 2020 is just 0.6 of GDP or national income - which is a rounding error in the context of a deficit that was a humongous 10 of GDP just five years ago.",1,xsum_human

"The rules of the St Petersburg lottery game, from Wikipedia: Consider the following game of chance: you pay a fixed fee to enter and then a fair coin is tossed until a head turns up. If the first toss results in a head, you win 2; if the first toss results in a tail, the coin is tossed again, and if the second toss results in a head, you win 4; if the second toss results in a tail, the coin is tossed again, and if the third toss results in a head, you win 8, and so on. A special case is when the game continues until the first head. In this case, the game is called a St Petersburg game or St Petersburg lottery. For example, if you win with the nth toss, your profit is 2n1 dollars.

"Running or walking on two legs is much more efficient than running or walking on four legs, although running on four legs is faster. Humans can't even outrun squirrels or other mammals who step in the same stride length as we do when they run. What this means is that if a human sprinted against another mammal such as an antelope, horses, deer, dogs and so forth (which have limbs set at different lengths), our superior speed would be matched by theirs. If one were to try to guess which animal will win based upon their stride lengths alone, it'd most likely be a dog because of its longer legs. But there's also something else: humans have longer arms proportionately with respect to our height compared with those limb-length-advantaged animals. That extra appendage allows us to use it for turning corners while braking and accelerating and lets us throw objects farther than any other living thing. Outside sports, humans are especially good climbers due to our long arms, strong fingers and powerful shoulders; from atop trees in mountainous areas, we're able to see hundreds of miles over wide swaths of land where no other creature has ever been before. Speaking of mountain climbing, in 1992 I was part of a team composed largely of regular walkers who made an attempt to climb Mount Everest. Most people don't realize that an estimated 100 million years ago, animals started evolving into bipeds - meaning having both feet on ground level instead of hooves like cows, for example. The first known creatures to become bipeds (bipedalism) were probably dinosaurs but that doesn't mean all other species didn't evolve to bipedality later. While some reptiles are still mostly quadrupedal today, many birds get around on two feet just fine. Spiders and scorpions' bodies appear similar enough when seen under magnification, and yet spiders move around on hind six legs when they need to whereas scorpions move about on multiple pair of legs. Then again, we should note that these latter two insects aren't really considered well-adapted for life above sea level since each leg only moves independently within the abdomen itself unlike ours, whose legs enable them to travel distances across continents via water currents to find food supplies. Some bats fly using tail flips rather than flapping wings, and ants make themselves airborne through explosive ejection bursts of air pressure given off by their cilia. There may not be anything remotely exciting about your pet parrot being able to remain suspended upside down when you toss him up in the air, but think back to how interesting it must've seemed to scientists centuries ago when whales dove deep underwater and came back up with a mouthful of fish. If you zoom in close enough, we'll notice details of the structure within the whale's baleen platelets - the former exposed fibers that line the jaw cavity leading to honing sharp edges that cut small prey items while larger ones slide past without inflicting harm. We now know that humpback whales spend 90 of their time hunting, feeding the highest percentage among marine predators by consuming between 65,000-100,000 calories per day! And soft corals turn seawater carbon dioxide back into oxygen by having algae viruses siphon nutrients away from coral polyps for photosynthesis! No wonder biologists love studying what makes these ocean dwellers tick, so to speak. Their brains are bigger too, weighing twice the amount of brain matter found in chimpanzees. These attributes lead me to believe that whales are far more intelligent than chimps, though perhaps less aware of sad events happening in the world outside? Not understanding why things happen tends to interfere with learning gained through observation, and we wouldn't want that kind of cognitive setback slowing down evolution right? Now that we've looked inside ourselves and taken an objective look at nature, let's return the favor and take a peek at exterior features to decide whether certain animals should rightfully be called ""more evolved"" than others. To accomplish this task, I created a scale ranking system comparing size, surface area, density, mass, strengthmobility, sensory perception abilities, body fat content, capability for breath control and longevity. As mentioned earlier, due to my design choice to incorporate visual representation alongside numerical data points, there are inherent limitations to examining factors such as agility or intelligence purely on numbers alone. For instance, measuring IQ always entails subjectivity since deciding which way of thinking qualifies as reasonable behavior is subjective. Even then, how exactly does one define normal versus abnormal thought processes? Likewise, measuring physical fitness always involves quantification as well as expert opinion regarding appropriateness. In general, however, weight isn't necessarily indicative of athleticism unless someone can show otherwise, and similarly, muscle bulk isn't sufficient proof that muscles contained therein possess greater energy stores relative to fat storage capacity. Yes, exercise helps build stronger bones and cardiovascular systems, but the load bearing ability of bone depends solely on bone mineralization, regardless of the efficiency of muscle contraction power generation. Intellectually speaking, vital signs are useful indicators when determining health status, but they shouldn't automatically dictate worthiness of symbolic value on the basis of appearance.

"That's the verdict of scientists who have analysed ancient DNA of the extinct animals for mutations. The studies suggest the last mammoths died out after their DNA became riddled with errors. The knowledge could inform conservation efforts for living animals. There are fewer than 100 Asiatic cheetahs left in the wild, while the remaining mountain gorilla population is estimated at about 300. The numbers are similar to those of the last woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean around 4,000 years ago. Dr Rebekah Rogers of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said the mammoths' genomes ""were falling apart right before they went extinct."" This, she said, was the first case of ""genomic meltdown"" in a single species. ""You had this last refuge of mammoths after everything has gone extinct on the mainland,"" she added. ""The mathematical theories that have been developed said that they should accumulate bad mutations because natural selection should become very inefficient."" The researchers analysed genetic mutations found in the ancient DNA of a mammoth from 4,000 years ago. They used the DNA of a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago, when populations were much larger, as a comparison. Woolly mammoths were once common in North America and Siberia. They were driven to extinction by environmental factors and possibly human hunting about 10,000 years ago. Small island populations clung on until about 4,000 years ago. ""There was this huge excess of what looked like bad mutations in the genome of the mammoth from this island,"" said Dr Rogers. ""We found these bad mutations were accumulating in the mammoth genome right before they went extinct."" Knowledge of the last days of the mammoth could help modern species on the brink of extinction, such as the panda, mountain gorilla and Indian elephant. The lesson from the woolly mammoth is that once numbers drop below a certain level, the population's genetic health may be beyond saving. Genetic testing could be one way to assess whether levels of genetic diversity in a species are enough to give it a chance of survival. A better option is to stop numbers falling too low. ""When you have these small populations for an extended period of time they can go into genomic meltdown, just like what we saw in the mammoth,"" said Dr Rogers. ""So if you can prevent these organisms ever being threatened or endangered then that will do a lot more to help prevent this type of genomic meltdown compared to if you have a small population and then bring it back up to larger numbers because it will still bear those signatures of this genomic meltdown."" Scientists think the genetic mutations may have given the last woolly mammoths ""silky, shiny satin fur."" Mutations may have also led to a loss of olfactory receptors, responsible for the sense of smell, as well as substances in urine involved in social status and attracting a mate. Love Dalen is professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and head of the team of scientists that originally published the DNA sequences of the mammoths. He said they found ""many deletions, big chunks of the genome that are missing, some of which even affected functional genes."" ""This is a very novel result,"" he said. ""If this holds up when more mammoth genomes, as well as genomes from other species, are analysed, it will have very important implications for conservation biology.""

"Same-Sex marriage in the US is one of the ""hottest"" news stories of June, and many people are upset that some politicians (especially democratic ones) have gone from being against it to being for it, which basically just means that they have re-evaluated their position in a manner that reflects their beliefs as a whole, and have made the decision to support gay marriage. That's right, they've ""come out"" in support of equal marriage rights for all, and their political opponents are taking this as an opportunity to try to exploit this ""change of heart"" as a weakness. Today, I read this article: It highlights the very simple, very straightforward, and very predictable republican response to this, which is: We are not going to change our position on this, because this is what the majority of our constituents want, and this is what the Bible says is wrong. The article goes on to state, ""Marriage is not an issue that people are voting on this fall,"" [Romney] said. ""They're voting on the economy and jobs and the like. And that's what I'm going to be talking about."" He's right about this, of course. There's no doubt that, this November, voters will be casting their ballots on the economy and jobs, but if the republicans are so convinced that they know the mind of their constituents, and that they know the will of the people, then why are they so afraid of this issue? You've already stated that you know what the majority of the people want, so what is so scary about this, that you need to do everything in your power to avoid the issue? Here's the thing: The majority of the people DO want equal rights for all, and this means that, in the long run, the republican party is going to lose support. Their resistance to this is a symptom of the fact that they are trying to appeal to a demographic of voters who are quickly becoming irrelevant in this country.

"Usually a Presbyterian church will not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a ""communion table,"" usually on the same level as the congregation. There may be a rail between the communion table and the ""Chancel"" behind it, which may contain a more decorative altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the ""empty"" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel.

"We propose a novel decomposition framework for the distributed optimization of Difference Convex (DC) -type nonseparable sum-utility functions subject to coupling convex constraints. A major contribution of the paper is to develop for the first time a class of (inexact) best-response-like algorithms with provable convergence, where a suitably convexified version of the original DC program is iteratively solved. The main feature of the proposed successive convex approximation method is its decomposability structure across the users, which leads naturally to distributed algorithms in the primal andor dual domain. The proposed framework is applicable to a variety of multiuser DC problems in different areas, ranging from signal processing, to communications and networking. As a case study, in the second part of the paper we focus on two examples, namely: i) a novel resource allocation problem in the emerging area of cooperative physical layer security; ii) and the renowned sum-rate maximization of MIMO Cognitive Radio networks.

Based upon spectral analysis techniques employed within geostatistical methods applied specifically to airborne lidar measurements, forecasts can be performed reliably even when predicted winds exceed those encountered in simulations allowing operators greater confidence levels regarding forecasting future loads. Additional benefits include improved accuracy when operating machinery beyond rated capacity thanks to reduced uncertainties inherent in modeling various hypothetical faults occurring simultaneously rather simply assigning zero values across multiple fault scenarios thus reducing likelihood error rates obtained while minimizing processing time requirements without compromising reliability if additional data not already available were provided.

"Chad opened the door, tossed his shoes off to the side, dropped his coffee mug onto the granite kitchen counter and wanted a few minutes to vegetate in front of the television before starting dinner. There, lying on his favorite leather cushion, was one dollar and eighty-five cents. One loonie, Three quarters, and a nickel. He stood there with his head tilted slightly to the left, blinking. That was the third time he found coins on his couch cushion in just as many weeks. Taking off his glasses, he rubbed his eyes and put them back on. Last night was his weekly guild-gaming night and his television, let alone his couch, didn't get any attention at all. Thinking harder, his he started wondering if Julie, his girlfriend, was letting herself into the apartment. Thinking about that, he rubbed his red stubble-laden cheeks. She didn't live close by and worked even further away, why would she come here? They had been dating for almost a year and a half and he knew she was The One, but it felt slightly unnerving that she would enter his place unannounced for reasons unknown. She knew he watched porn on occasion, he wasn't the type of person to hide it. It wasn't something to be ashamed of. It was just a tool to help facilitate self-pleasure when he was alone and aroused. He frowned and his brown eyes darkened. He was not impressed, and as the seconds ticked by his annoyance started turning towards anger. What was she looking for? Drugs? Child porn? Did she think he was cheating on her? Was she cheating on him in his house? Seething, he pulled out his phone and started writing what could be the start of a very big fight. ' What are you doing in my apartment?'His finger went straight for the send button and froze for a moment, hovering. Just outside of his periphery, as he wrote the inflammatory text, a small grey eight-legged spider scaled up the horizontal crack between both cushions up to the top and crawled quickly into the center. It turned around and looked up at Chad. "" Stop! Stop it! "" He growled and drew in a deep breath. Never before had he been this mad with her, made even worse because he didn't know why he was mad. Well, he did: his privacy had been invaded, but the rational side of him said there had to be a good reason. "" Is that not enough? "" The quiet but high-pitched voice startling Chad. He looked up and from his phone into his empty living room. "" What? "" He muttered lowly, the living room was empty. Reflexively, his right leg moved back, ready to be spun around on. He looked over his shoulder into the kitchen, empty, and to his left down the hall leading to the bathroom and his bedroom. "" Hello? "" He asked. "" Who's there? Julie? "" It couldn't have been Julie, even with helium that voice was much too high. "" Down here, Chad. "" The markedly female voice was coming from the living room. He whipped his head around only to see his furniture and nothing else. "" W-who are you? Where are you? "" The high feminine voice sighed. "" Down here. Couch. "" Chad looked to the couch, empty. Furrowing his brow, he muttered: "" I'm going crazy. "" "" Down here! "" The voice squeaked, starting losing patience. His eyes skimmed the black leather down to the empty cushion - except the far one wasn't quite empty. A small grey spider, no bigger than a dime, sat in the middle with one of its legs partially off it. It went up and down slightly, like a wiggling finger or possibly a wave. Chad's lips parted slightly while his brown eyes went wide. "" You didn't just - "" He muttered then shook his head. "" - no, not possible. "" He rubbed his eyes again, only this time wondering if a coworker had slipped something into his afternoon coffee. "" Yes. "" The voice was coming from the spider. He even saw the tiny mandibles moving back and forth as the spider spoke. Chad went white. "" Don't faint. Oh, please don't faint. "" The Android fell from Chad's paralyzed hand, thunked against the light stained hard wood and thunked a second time as the phone dropped onto its face. On the couch, the spider visibly winced. "" Oh, don't do that..... "" "" What the hell? "" "" Sit! "" The high-pitched spider exclaimed and scurried off to the side. "" Just not on me! "" Chad did, noting that he was sitting on his couch because a spider told him to. "" Okay. You remember me, right? "" The spider asked. "" I-I think...I think I'd remember a talking spider. "" "" So, no. "" The spider sighed and nodded - her whole front motioned up and down. "" You were going to the bathroom about a month ago. I guess you saw me when you were half asleep. Anyways, I'll introduce myself again. I'm M'rruu'hle, tenth generation of the M'rrria'hle Cluster. My silver line got trapped on an errant wind current and blew me through your window. I had a look around, really liked the place - a nice selection of food - and decided to stay. The coins are my rent payment, but I thought you knew this...I thought it might not be enough. "" Chad listened to everything M'rruu'hle said and found it a perfectly reasonable explanation, but was also floating in a strange cloudy, vaguely comforting, place between his (and a talking spider's) apartment and numbness. He shook his head, bringing himself back to reality, and rubbed his eyes. "" No. It's enough. "" He said still feeling a bit numb and hazy. "" I...I thought my girlfriend was coming in while I'm gone. "" "" Julie? Wonderful lady! Can I make a suggestion though? "" M'rruu'hle asked. "" Uh, sure. "" He said thinking: I'm about to get advice form a spider. A FRICKING TALKING SPIDER! "" She does not like that red pasta sauce you make. "" "" Oh. "" "" So, uh, now that we have formally met, again, mind if I stay? "" She asked. "" I'm clean, you know I'm not loud, and, uh, I can make sure you don't have bugs! You human's hate ' em, us spider's love em! "" Chad actually started contemplating the Spider's rental request, smirked and let out a chuckle. How do I draw up a rental agreement? He thought and shrugged. "" I guess so...just make yourself scarce when Julie's around or I'll have to kill you. "" "" That I can do! "" M'rruu'hle exclaimed happily. "" But I have one small request. "" "" Sure. "" "" When you leave for a couple days, can you please leave a window open? A girl's got ta eat! "" Edit: words",1,wp_human

"Graphlets are induced subgraph patterns and have been frequently applied to characterize the local topology structures of graphs across various domains, e.g., online social networks (OSNs) and biological networks. Discovering graph-fillings is a fundamental problem for graph fillers as it allows us to understand the utility of the small changes in graph structure that can result from graph filling. The theoretical study of graphs' topological properties has produced several methods for finding graph fillings, i.e., small modifications with respect to the basic graph. However, many existing algorithms fail at finding graph fillings that exhibit desirable properties such as high fitness and low clonality index. To improve on this state of the art, we propose a novel graph filling algorithm, named Random Graphs Filler for Local Topologies (GRFLT), which uses a randomized approach to find graph fillings efficiently. The performance of GRFLT is evaluated using benchmark datasets including OSN profiles and bionetworks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art graph filling methods by a significant margin in terms of both efficiency and convergence speed.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b

I found myself trapped in a monotonous routine, with only a few rare moments of enjoyment to break the monotony. I was left questioning the screenwriters' ability to have a clear direction or purpose as the plot was incredibly convoluted. Despite having a cast of popular celebrities, the movie could not be salvaged as their acting lacked intensity, just like my own breathing being restrained. The film's visual presentation was a chaotic mixture of dull colors and unimpressive camerawork, leading to increased frustration with the overall experience. I had a hard time searching for a shot that could evoke any feeling in me. The music in the movie did not leave a lasting impression and was just like ambient sound that went unnoticed in my mind. Upon leaving the theater, I felt an immense sense of relief as the movie's grip on me, represented by its plastic bag, had finally let go. Ultimately, I would advise against exposing yourself to this overwhelming movie catastrophe - unless you are in a dire need of some sleep.",0,imdb_gpt4_para
"Samuel Tweed, 74, from Mark Street in Newtownards, County Down, had also admitted possession of a haul of guns along with 2,500 rounds of ammunition. He escaped from custody at Belfast Magistrates' Court in May 1974 when he was facing firearms charges. He had been arrested in connection with the discovery of a weapons cache in the city the previous month. The haul included 10 revolvers, nine pistols, a sawn-off shotgun and assorted ammunition. Tweed was 32 when he escaped after a group of men entered the courtroom and claimed there was a bomb in the building. He remained undetected until his arrest in 2012. First Minister Peter Robinson was one of a number of DUP politicians who wrote letters urging the judge not to jail Mr Tweed. The court also heard that the great-grandfather had led a law-abiding life since his escape and was suffering from bad health. The judge told the court that although Tweed was a younger man when the offences were committed, that did not diminish their seriousness. ""I am satisfied that you have lived a lawful and law-abiding life over the last 40 years,"" he added.

"The rate of serum AFP andor hCG decline during the first two cycles of therapy was predictive for event-free and overall survival in GCT patients treated with ifosfamide-based salvage therapy. Those patients with an appropriate serum tumor marker decline had a longer event-free and overall survival. When evaluated separately, the rate of hCG decline was more predictive of treatment outcome than decline of AFP.

"Prediction and control of the dynamics of complex networks is a central problem in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.",1,sci_gen_human

Gasping, those who chose to watch turned heads as it screamed over and beyond, and then away, glancing through our biosphere so narrowly. Those moments of uncertainty I will never forget.

"Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is - in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention. Lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transsexual youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience. The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.",1,squad_human

"Future advances in deep learning and its impact on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in all fields depends heavily on data size and computational power. Sacrificing massive computing resources in exchange for better precision rates of the network model is recognized by many researchers. This leads to huge computing consumption and satisfactory results are not always expected when computing resources are limited. Therefore, it is necessary to find a balance between resources and model performance to achieve satisfactory results. This article proposes a self-adaptive quality of experience (QoE) framework, DeepNetQoE, to guide the training of deep networks. A self-adaptive QoE model is set up that relates the model's accuracy with the computing resources required for training which will allow the experience value of the model to improve. To maximize the experience value when computer resources are limited, a resource allocation model and solutions need to be established. In addition, we carry out experiments based on four network models to analyze the experience values with respect to the crowd counting example. Experimental results show that the proposed DeepNetQoE is capable of adaptively obtaining a high experience value according to user needs and therefore guiding users to determine the computational resources allocated to the network models.",1,sci_gen_human

"Understanding E3 ligase and target substrate interactions are important for cell biology and therapeutic development. However, experimental identification of E3 target relationships is not an easy task due to the labor-intensive nature of the experiments. In this article, a sequence-based E3-target prediction model is proposed for the first time. The proposed framework utilizes composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) to learn the relationship between E3 ligases and their target protein. A class separable latent space encoding scheme is also devised that provides a compressed representation of feature space. A thorough ablation study is performed to identify an optimal gap size for CKSAAP and the number of latent variables that can represent the E3-target relationship successfully. The proposed scheme is evaluated on an independent dataset for a variety of standard quantitative measures. In particular, it achieves an average accuracy of 70.63 on an independent dataset.

In fact, having excess body fat may even make acid reflux worse, according to previous research from those same scientists. Because I was experiencing some minor symptoms during work hours, such as feeling nauseous when eating certain foods, burning throat sensation after drinking coffeetea without milk and burping loudly while talking on the phone for a long period of time, I decided to do an initial test: If you get up around 6 AM and eat breakfast within 4-5 hours afterwards, there should be enough food in your stomach to keep anything acidic inside until 10 PM - which would give me approximately 36 hours to see if everything remains okay once I start working again at 5PM daily.

"The rise of TikTok has been unprecedented. It's become one of the most popular social media platforms, especially among teens and young adults. But why is it so addictive? It turns out, there are several psychological factors at play that contribute to its success. First off, TikTok's algorithm is designed to keep users engaged. By monitoring user behavior and interests, the app can curate a personalized feed tailored to each individual user. As a result, users consistently find new content they're interested in, which keeps them coming back for more. Second, TikTok also takes advantage of our natural tendency to be curious and explore new things.

"Leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers I must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of ""happiness"" for all is. Is there justification for the enforced benefit and ""happiness""? How much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. It seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.",1,imdb_human

"Well, if you were training to be a marathon runner, that's probably the simplest as far as just breaking into it. First you would train and enter and compete for a public race, the Boston Marathon and New York Marathon are great ones, with lot's of news coverage. You would want to come in first, at which point news would cover you, and sponsors would come to you offering money in return for you wearing ADIDAS over Nike, or UnderArmour instead of Generic Clothing Brand. And then if you were good enough, you would just keep racing and training and eventually be contacted by your nation's government with a proposal to join an all-insert country here team. You would start competing against other nations, and when they felt you were the best person to represent the nation, they would take you to the Olympics. But there is another route, there is always a handful of ""independents"" at the Olympics, they tend not to get very far, but they are a group of people, from wherever around the world who essentially front the money needed for the Olympics themselves, and compete. as long as they qualify.', ""Different sports have different selection processes, not to mention variations between countries. However, I can tell you how the fencing selection works in Canada. Join a local fencing club. Take lessons, compete in the club, and then get a competitive license (most people do this after a year or so, even if they're not planning on the Olympics.) Compete in the local competitions, of which there are about eight a year. You accumulate points depending on your ranking and the competition level, and you are ranked by points in the province and the country. Included in these competitions are the provincial and regional finals. Now your points on the national ranking scale may allow you to compete in the national competitions, and at that point you can start applying to fence on the world cup circuit. This will take you all over the place, usually at your own expense. So if at this point you are (a) one of the top fencers in the country, and (b) ranked high enough on the world circuit, you will be chosen for the Olympic team. Then you go to the Olympics, and place in the top 64. Realistically, I can't imagine that the single most talented fencer on the planet training constantly could go from zero to the Olympics in less than about five years. Ten is more likely.,"" ""There is no amount of training that is going to get the average joe to be Olympic caliber and competitive in a large country for a popular sport like the marathon. There are just to many people with better than average genetics that will out compete the average joe, they will get the same training since someone recognized that talent early on. Instead move to a small country that participates in few Olympic sports (ie Jamaica). Pick a sport they don't currently participate in (ie Bobsledding). In addition to training actively lobby the government to recognize youyour team as the official representatives of the country through whatever mechanism they have to pick Olympic athletes. In America that choice is done by the various sporting organizations that the government recognizes as the people regulating the sport for the Olympics. In small countries its much looser. Plan on providing your own funding since the government won't. You still have to qualify for the Olympics, the various sports have different rules on that. Just because you have a team and a government sponsor you have to meet some standards to compete at the actual Olympics.,Since I'm an American, I'll use the process for qualifying in the U.S. In order to qualify for the Olympic marathon team, you must participate in a marathon sanctioned by the national track and field governing body that takes place during a certain time frame (August 1, 2015 to 30 days before the Olympic qualifier). During one of those events, you must run a time that meets our beats the international ""B"" Standard. Doing so qualifies you for the Olympic Trials marathon, where the top X finishers qualify for the Olympics. [Here] (URL0) is my source.",1,eli5_human

"I push off the ground, leaving a wake of dirt to fly off against the schoolyard wall. Once, the schoolyard had been asphalt, so those caught in the spray squeal as their exos blind them behind a shield. Kendall gives chase, shouting my name, commanding proximity. I deny his request and increase base velocity. Overhead, several cargo freighters pile by, their under-racks, normally used to quickly relocate train cars, retrofitted for the Triplicate Legion. These were empty, but even Kendall slowed and looked up to see if any soldiers were aboard. Disappointment sifted aside, I dive and weave through a gaggle of lower-thirds. Those whose exos have pulse jumpers activate them and shoot their wards from my line; those who don't simply freeze. When there is nowhere to weave, I thank the Triplicate that my father holds rank enough to afford the same pulse jumpers and leap fifteen feet into the air, whirling to the cheers of my classmates, and then spring ahead. If my father didn't hold rank, would I be chased at all? ""No fair!"" screams Kendall, falling away. I'm breathing heavily, but slow to a stop. As I inhale, several holes open in the front of my exo, letting even more air in; three tracheas are better than one. Moments later, my blood is oxygenated, my legs are ready for another round. On the outside, the exos don't appear any different. Simple, white plates covering the chest, like shoulder blades on the front. Similar allocations on the hips, and the sides of the thighs and triceps. Then, soles of the feet, and a horseshoe band from the brain stem around to the temples. On the inside, however, opulence affected performance. The more money one had, the deeper the exo probed. My lungs, heart, and stomach were coated in a material that would harden instantly if struck by ballistics. Same with my skull. Such as it was, Kendall had no such applications on his exo. His father worked as a loadsman, so the only real enhancements he had were in his lifting strength. He'd someday take over the family business. ""Gotcha!"" shouted Wynn, grappling my arms. Kendall, huffing, started to run over, a grin crossed with a scowl on his face. ""I got you, you little termite!"" But no son of a soldier was ever so easily captured. I pulsed from the left leg, then from the right. I was smaller, but the power of the air pumped from my exo put Wynn off-kilter on the first pump, and laid him low on the second. I had been strictly, and in no uncertain terms, told to not do what I was about to, but here I was, and there they were. Kendall was fifteen yards out. I charged. As the soles of my feet reached perpendicular to my body, further airbursts were emitted. The first few times I did this, when I was only five, my brain felt funny. Now, I felt the rush. Kendall reared his fist back for the sort of punch that would crack ribs; as he delivered, my thigh pulsed out reflexively, my head went down and under the potential blow, and I used the same emphasis in my arm that he did, slamming him with a palm-out shot to his exo that sent him reeling to his bottom. I didn't finish a step toward him before I felt a hand on my shoulder and a rush of air. Teacher was here. I was in deep trouble.",1,wp_human

"Today is my birthday. It's taken me a while to decide when exactly to establish the date of my birth. If you'll stay and listen, I'll tell you the story. My name is Carmen Torres, and I have been writing for 15 years now in order to keep myself company during the day so that my husband can get some sleep with me every night (heaven forbid!). I am an independent woman who loves cooking, reading books about food recipes along with my food obsession. myself! When I'm not making sandwiches or eating out, I spend time playing on guitar, singing songs like ""Keep the Lights On,"" performing with my family and listening to my favorite music playlist - ""God Bless America"" by Rollins Brothers (love you guys!) or watching movies such as ""The Hunger Games."" Tonight we've decided to celebrate by knocking off the Christmas tree at our house! We took it easy this year because we weren't able to go to church Sunday and didn't want to waste Christmas Eve, but I know that doesn't mean we're skipping out on Christmas gifts just yet!! There are many things that are better left unsaid... and things that need keeping quiet!:) So what do you think? Oh yeah, it gets difficult finding places to eat pretty much anywhere around here!!! Well there isn't even one place where we don't frequent currently. There aren't any places close enough to us to enjoy it ALL the time besides Chili's, which is on East Main Street nearby, where everyone will be happy to see us sometime soon!!!!! Posted by It was Christmas morning before the bus arrived in town yesterday afternoon. I watched the holidays unfold throughout the day until I awoke from my nap feeling warm and fuzzy inside.... more warmth than I usually feel today!!!!!!! Time flew by...... although I guess you'd never hear me complain if you believe me!:) After waking up yesterday morning, we had breakfast together tonight. Our friend Cindy came over after school and caught up with us. Everyone agreed that it would make for great holiday dinner parties! Cindy made us all turkey sandwiches and scrambled eggs and I got to take advantage of the wonderful weather and warm days outside.:) On Friday night, we were busy gathering gifts for people looking forward to Christmas together..... jerky cookies, pumpkin pie rolls, cranberry sauce,... the list goes on and on!!! All weekend long, the children visited Martha's Vineyard, enjoying the warm weather outside. They did amazingly well adjusting to living outdoors:) This week, we were invited to attend a Christmas Eve party hosted by my friend Julia and her family for her daughter's seniors. Although I wasn't sure how much fun it would really be having the kids around, there were definitely some challenges.... you guessed it, Carrie had no idea what to expect. Plus it was our first Christmas Eve party since Carrie moved home from New York City last summer........... well except for the fact that she stayed up till 3am each day?!?!?? As with most kids, Carrie knew little else about Thanksgiving compared to others... although she said she wanted to decorate with Santa, decorate pizza, play Santa Claus and go out to eat more often......... seriously, we ate way too much and enjoyed ourselves very much!! She knows how to party! This past weekend we celebrated Thanksgiving Dinner with family and friends. Carrie's parents live 5 minutes away from home so they brought their son, Alex, along as his grandparents were visiting. Alex loved spending time with all his cousins including his grandmother who waited patiently in his ""little angel crib."" Thankfully Carrie actually showed up early and sat outside on the porch waiting for Alex to come back down the stairs before 8pm... she's always ready to greet him whenever he comes home from school!! Despite the cold weather, Carrie still managed to cook Thanksgiving meal worth celebrating all by herself! Her grandpa, Carl, kept her entertained through supper with dessert treats and fun games like ours....... after all this winter snow has done nothing to prepare Carley for Thanksgiving, we sure wish she could visit the island again!:) Yesterday, Carrie asked Katie if she could help decorating her room. Katie worked hard last night filling the little cupboards filled with decorations and lights.... it looks fantastic already!

"In this paper we introduce a new method for text detection in natural images. The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2 on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU.",1,sci_gen_human

"On Friday, a 34-year-old woman became the second person in three weeks to die at the busy Bow Roundabout junction. The victim, who is yet to be named, was pronounced dead at 16:45 GMT. The 29-year-old driver of a lorry involved in the crash was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He was released on bail to return to an east London police station on 7 December pending further inquiries. The London Cycling Campaign (LCC) group demanded an immediate redesign of the roundabout. It said the roundabout was dangerous because the cycle superhighway stopped in the middle of the Bow roundabout. LCC's chief executive Ashok Sinha said: ""We're appalled at this latest preventable death and are fearful of what may happen when large numbers of cyclists are expected to tackle this junction on their way to and from the Olympics next year. ""We can't understand how this junction can form part of what is one of the Mayor's flagship cycling projects: it must be redesigned now."" TfL surface transport manager Leon Daniels said: ""We are extremely sorry to learn of the tragic death of a female cyclist, following a collision with an HGV on the Bow Road roundabout on Friday evening. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends. I have visited the scene and both TfL and the police have launched inquiries which will report as quickly as possible."" Last month a 58-year-old man was killed in a collision with a tipper truck. Four priority lanes for cyclists, branded cycle superhighways, have been painted blue around London, and another eight are due to open within the next four years.

Cycling blogger Danny Williams said: ""I think the superhighways should be made proper superhighways. ""I think it's a good idea, incredibly badly implemented and not very well thought through, and the Mayor needs to take responsibility for that. A TfL spokesman said: ""There has been an 18 fall in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured on London's roads in the last decade, compared to the TfL's baseline figures from the mid to late 1990s.""

"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for children infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has a consistent impact on their growth. Many research studies have demonstrated that administering HAART to HIV positive children results in considerable enhancements in growth metrics including body weight, height, and BMI. The enhancements are most noticeable in the initial years of treatment but can persist for longer durations if the therapy is continued. It is important to consider that the effectiveness of HAART in supporting growth is influenced by various elements, such as the child's age when treatment began, the length of the treatment, following the medication routine, and other clinical and social factors. To sum up, HAART has a long-lasting and beneficial effect on the development of children with HIV; however, specific results are influenced by various factors. The child's growth and well-being largely depend on effective disease management through timely detection and consistent use of medication.",0,pubmed_gpt4_para

"Scientists have 3D printed cyanobacteria and graphene onto a mushroom in order to produce electricity. Shining a light on the cyanobacteria will kickstart their photosynthesis, which causes them to give off electrons that get transferred to the mushrooms' leaves via a conductive thread created using nanotechnology. The end result is an entire forest of electrical plants growing atop each other like trees - but without any need for soil or sunlight. While this may seem like science fiction, the researchers from Queen Mary University believe they are one step closer toward creating sustainable energy sources by harnessing nature itself: By combining carbon-based materials with bacteria capable of producing biomass (i.e., organic matter), we can create sturdier versions of natural systems. This latest experiment has been described as ""a major breakthrough in synthetic biology"" because it involves two different organisms working together through complex chemical processes instead of just relying on solar power alone. While scientists haven't yet managed to generate enough current to run anything more than small devices such as LEDs at full capacity, future research could lead to low-energy power grids where everything runs straight off microbial fuel cells.",0,tldr_machine_continuation_opt_30b

"[step] This has a lighter coverage, so it won't look as chalky. The eyes are the attention drawer in this look, so everything else needs to fall behind and blend.

The moisturizer is another step up from the already popular blonde which holds three shades (red, pink, blue.) While the shade was originally designed for red lips, it now also works well even better than gold if paired with red cheeks because it's easier to apply using blush rather than a nude color like other shades such as pink. While most people choose yellow over green when choosing their face masks due to its more subtle blue-green tone, the shades still work great together! Wet Skin Eyes Makeup White Eyeshadow This makeup product can be easily applied without touching your skin, making it perfect for any occasion including weddings too! Wet Skin Eyes is formulated specifically to help give your complexion natural glow while protecting against moisture loss caused by sun damage and age spots. It offers a soft touch that helps smooth out the wrinkles along with a beautiful dark brown tinted foundation. This makeup application company consists of three products: Wet Skin Eyes Glow Powder, Wet Skin Eyes Eye Gel Dermalogica (which comes in three different shades), and Wet Skin Eyes Eye Shadow Powder. Wet Skin Eyes Powder doesn't require primer either since there isn't much need for powder; water will suffice thanks to the lightweight formula. Wet Skin Eyes Eye Cream gives your lashes some volume relief but protects them during sweat sessions. Wet Skin Eyes Eye Cream provides waterproof protection compared to other creams using the same formulation but keeps your eyelashes clean enough to keep eye drops from drying out. Wet Skin Eyes Eye Cream proper goes further than almost any other makeup basecoat you'll find except for the possibility of an oily finish just sitting there instead of moving. Wet Skin Eyes Powder does have a small amount of scent though which makes applying it difficult - but it definitely improves its scent consistency overall appearance. Wet Skin Eyes Powder is available online here. Blackface If you're looking for something less expensive than other beauty brands' products, Blackface Beauty is a good choice.

All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to replace existing apprenticeships in a way that ensures there is no loss or diminution in quality and potential for innovation while ensuring the sustainability of apprenticeship training systems. Apprenticeship professionals want more than just more people coming into training. They also want better support from employers, an end to ""unfair"" rules around employment agreements which prevent workers having rights such as being able to trade unions, and a system where everyone has access to skills so they can take on work that suits them best. The claims came to light at the Institute of Apprenticeships annual conference in London this week. The event was attended by employers, government ministers and other stakeholders including academics and representatives from trade unions. Professor Adam Price, director general of the institute, told delegates: ""There needs to be some kind of systematic review going forward because it does seem after 25 years there has been very little change in terms of what's being done in terms of increasing the supply of apprentices. There hasn't been any significant growth but if you look over time the numbers have actually decreased. So why are we in this situation? Is it because there isn't enough funding?

"Understanding E3 ligase and target substrate interactions are important for cell biology and therapeutic development. However, experimental identification of E3 target relationships is not an easy task due to the challenges of biochemical assays and the difficulty of identifying an E3 and substrate among hundreds of candidates. Furthermore, computational methods for identifying E3 targets have focused on linear sequence motif analysis, which cannot be used to identify E3 targets that lack linearly conserved motifs. Therefore, we developed an integrated method that combines sequence, structural, and evolutionary features of the E3 ligase and substrate to predict E3 target substrate relationships. Using a training set of 212 E3 and substrate pairs, we were able to develop a Random Forest classifier that achieves 92 accuracy. We then applied this method to identify potential E3-substrate relationships in ubiquitination pathways. We hope that our method will be useful in identifying potential E3 substrate relationships in ubiquitination pathways.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_65B

This vase had been there for many years, always eager to hold fresh flowers and brighten up the room. But one day, something terrible happened. A stranger came into the cottage, and before anyone knew it, there was a struggle. The vase watched in horror as the stranger grabbed a knife and plunged it into the heart of the cottage's owner. The vase couldn't believe what was happening. In all its years of sitting on the windowsill, it had never witnessed anything like this. The cheerful little vase had always been a silent observer of the daily happenings in the cottage, from the peaceful moments to the occasional arguments. But now, with blood pooling on the floor and the stranger running out of the cottage, the vase knew it had to do something. It couldn't just sit there and let the owner lay there lifeless. So, the vase did the only thing it could think of - it shifted on its windowsill, causing a chain reaction that knocked over a potted plant. The noise alerted a neighbor, who rushed over to see what was happening. The vase was relieved when the authorities arrived and the murderer was caught.

His wife Katharina was overheard saying, ""Dear husband, you are too rude,"" and he responded, ""Katharina is not a pen name - she has her own name."" Although Hillerich had been an ardent advocate of the revival movement during its early stages (1810-12), by 1824 it became apparent that this liberal Pentecostal renewal had come to naught; more than half a century later, when the Second Great Awakening began spreading rapidly through America in 1830s and 1840s, there were no evangelical leaders who could be said to have originated from or exemplified what may variously be called evangelistic vitality, apostolic faithfulness, charismatic authority, ethical holiness, intellectual effort, fervent prayer life, theological depth, or spiritual maturity - all essential if true Christianity should survive at all among Christians today. In contrast with those eighteenth-century German missionaries whose labors would culminate successfully over three decades so remarkably well under Erasmus Reinke, Martino Martini, Johann Peter Kirschner, Johann Friedrich Konigshoffen, Karl Hermann Conze, Abraham Sasse, Johannes Zeisberger, Martin Bucer, George Rapp and others throughout Asia Minor, the American church floundered for nearly two centuries before being reawakened as The United States Christian Reformed Church. In both Germany and North America, these mission endeavors resulted in only scattered congregations primarily composed of Germans: without 250 years' experience gaining such success abroad, few Revivals can occur where none existed previously. Hence, excepting some brief revivals led briefly thereafter by itinerant preachers like Charles Finney America's First Evangelist and Dwight L. Moody, most American evangelicals remain unaware how deeply they need the kind of leadership provided initially by men like Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, Zwingle, BullingerBraunau, Dabney, Beza, Schleiermacher, Naumburg, Kelch, Hutter and many other earnest reformers who created systematic theology brought forth into practical application by faithful pastors and servants of God who did their duty faithfully according to Scripture alone which defines authentic restoration. - David Balsiger",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_30b

"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, and I'm interested in hearing other's opinions on the matter. I've heard the argument that many people don't vaccinate their children because of various health problems, religious reasons, or because they fear that vaccinations are not safe. My counterargument to this is that if everyone were to be vaccinated, the risk of spreading diseases would be significantly reduced, and it would make it safer for those that are unable to be vaccinated, because less people would be immune to the diseases. In addition, the argument that vaccinations are not safe has been proven false, and the study that claimed that autism was associated with vaccination has been debunked. Also, the argument that parents should have the right to decide whether or not they want to vaccinate their children is quite similar to the argument that parents should have the right to decide whether or not their children should go to school. My counterargument is that the right to decide whether or not to go to school should be taken away from parents, because the public school is a public good, and the parents are taking resources away from the public. I'm interested in hearing other's opinions on this matter, and why people feel they should be allowed to make decisions that affect the public, but not be forced to make decisions that affect the public. I do have to say that I'm very interested in the vaccine argument because my family has had to deal with some major health issues in the last year because of the fact that my brother and I haven't been vaccinated. I've always been afraid to vaccinate because of the autism scare, and now I'm just afraid to vaccinate in general because I don't know what to do. I've decided not to vaccinate, but I'm not sure whether or not that was a good decision. I'd be interested to see what other people have to say about this, and I'd be interested to hear how other people feel about mandatory vaccinations. It would help if you cited some sources. I'm not going to bother citing sources for the vaccine argument. I feel like it's pretty clear to anyone who has a basic understanding of science, or the history of medicine, or the history of vaccination that vaccination has a tremendous benefit to society. I've seen a few studies, but I don't feel like spending more time researching it, or going to the library. If you would like some sources, you could probably look at the peer reviewed medical journals. I'm not going to bother citing sources for the public school argument, because it's simply a matter of opinion. I just think that vaccines are the best thing we have for protecting public health. I also think that vaccinations are the most important thing we can do to prevent the spread of disease, and I think that there is absolutely no reason to not vaccinate your children unless you have a major health problem, such as a weakened immune system. I also believe that if everyone were vaccinated, it would be much safer for those that are unable to be vaccinated, because the people that are vaccinated are immune to the diseases. As for the counterargument, I'm not sure if I'm very clear on what you're trying to say here. The argument that people shouldn't be forced to go to school, because it's a public good, and they're using resources, sounds fairly similar to the argument that people shouldn't be forced to vaccinate their children, because they're using resources. I'm not sure if I'm making any sense, but I hope that my response is helpful. Edited March 26, 2014 by Elyse I'm not trying to be rude or anything but it is hard to discuss a topic if you don't cite sources. So I would recommend citing sources for your information.

"Around the sixth century AD, a tribe of Slavs arrived in a portion of Central Europe. According to legend they were led by a hero named Cech, from whom the word ""Czech"" derives. The ninth century brought the state of Great Moravia, whose first ruler (Rastislav of Moravia) invited Byzantine ruler Michael III to send missionaries in an attempt to reduce the influence of East Francia on religious and political life in his country. These missionaries, Constantine and Methodius, helped to convert the Czechs from traditional Slavic paganism to Christianity and established a church system. They also brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the West Slavs, whose language was previously unwritten. This language, later known as Proto-Czech, was beginning to separate from its fellow West Slavic hatchlings Proto-Slovak, Proto-Polish and Proto-Sorbian. Among other features, Proto-Czech was marked by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant and consistent stress on the first syllable.",1,squad_human

Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, including Chios and Psara, committing wholesale massacres of the population.

"I'm a male and I'm a rabid anti-feminist. Many feminists, including people in academics would say I'm a misogynist. But I disagree. I'm very much for equal rights of women, and I do think we live in a sexist society. However, I'm very much against what feminism has become in the last few years or so. I'll break down one by one on things I hate about feminism. False Rape accusations: Feminists claim this is a non-issue. And that you should NEVER EVER question the supposed victim, even though that means loss of freedom for the supposed perpetrator. Rape 2.0 (tm): Claims that if a woman has even 2 drinks, and a man has sex with her, he committed an act of rape. I can't find the exact article. But there was a guy at a college, who texted a girl for a booty call that happened to be drunk. The whole thing seemed consensual, as the girl did text the guy to bring a condom and invited him over. The guy gets kicked out of college for sexual assault. Even though they have both been drinking. Rape 2.0 also is apart of the new ""Yes means yes"" law in California. Shirtgate: A guy who accomplished landing a probe on a comet gets attacked by feminists for wearing a tackey shirt. Was the shirt unprofessional? Sure. But that was not sexist or misogynistic, in fact, a female friend made the shirt for him. Donglegate: A guy gets fired for making a joke about dongles. Feminists are now running the government, and messing up men's lifes. Therefore, I'm an anti-feminist, but an egalitarian. So just because I'm against feminism, does NOT make me a misogynist.

"It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living cell an enzyme that is not found in any other animal. This discovery also might pave the way for better understanding of how diseases develop through genetics. Research into this field has been rapidly increasing, with many more people turning their minds to Alzheimer's disease than ever before. Liver cancer becomes rarer as a result of improved treatments, but it still affects thousands every year. Scientists believe they have identified a novel target therapy for the most common type - hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - by targeting another protein associated with its development. In research published on 13 May 2013 in Cancer Cell, researchers from the Institute of Medicine and University College London report that ""a targeted approach using antibodies known as apoptosis-inducing kinases (AIKs), was able to significantly reduce the incidence of HCC in mice. [...] The finding is important because it suggests that a drug, such as BRCA, which targets HCC or certain proteins involved in the development of HCC may be useful in treating HCC elsewhere in the body."" [...] According to Professor John C. Maxham, director at the Institute of Cancer Research, ""We are now working to test whether patients who have had a previous treatment should be given a cocktail of AKT inhibitors, rather than just one at present to see if this will benefit them. We need further tests to determine the quantity of treatment necessary and whether these molecules prevent tumour growth altogether."" He added: ""These findings suggest a potentially effective therapeutic strategy against a very serious problem, where we lose too many Liver cancers each year."" Alzheimer's Disease In 2004, scientists used genetic sequencing techniques to construct an array of genes linked together in a way that correlated with Alzheimer's (AD). Based upon those levels, the team discovered four single gene mutations. They were excluded from future studies due to ethical concerns, however, when a pair of identical twins developed AD and died within months of one another. Three years later, the same set of twin brothers began developing the disease, coinciding with the first two cases of AD. Researchers concluded that familial clustering of the genetic variants explained both instances of AD. Following the case of the twin sisters, researchers determined that this discovery would likely be adopted into clinical practice. However, data on the blood samples of the affected individuals indicates that there is no correlation between the number of copies of the two genetic variants and the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. There are currently no cures for the disease and only options include medication, surgery and behavioral therapies. What inspired you to write about your experiences?

"Norwich, UK - A 16-year-old boy from Norwich, who had been arrested in connection with an alleged data theft from TalkTalk, has been released on bail until March. The boy, who has not been named, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of supplying stolen data to cyber criminals. The arrest was made after a joint investigation by the police and the National Crime Agency. TalkTalk, a UK-based telecommunications company, suffered a major data breach in October last year, whereby attackers stole the personal details of more than 150,000 customers. The company later admitted that the cyber attack had also resulted in the theft of bank details of around 20,000 customers. The 16-year-old boy was taken to a police station in Norwich for questioning after his arrest, and has now been released on bail until March pending further investigation. The police have not yet released any details about how the data was stolen or how the boy came to be in possession of it, but have stated that their investigation is ongoing. TalkTalk has been under scrutiny for its handling of the data breach, with criticism levelled at the company for not taking sufficient measures to protect its customers' data. The company has offered free credit monitoring to affected customers and has launched a review of its security measures in response to the breach. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the police investigation will be and whether the 16-year-old will be charged in connection with the alleged data theft.",0,xsum_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo
"A 30-year-old man who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl he met online has been sentenced to 12 months in jail. The man, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, used the internet to groom the young girl, who had a vulnerable background. According to the prosecutor, the offender had created a fake profile on a social media platform, posing as a 17-year-old boy. He spent weeks talking to the girl online, gradually building up her trust, before arranging to meet her in person. When they met, he took her to a secluded area and sexually assaulted her. The girl was left traumatized by the experience and reported the incident to the police. The judge in the case described the man's behavior as ""sickening"" and emphasized the need for a strong message to be sent to others who engage in online grooming. Speaking after the sentencing, the victim's mother said she was relieved that justice had been done, but also called for greater awareness of the dangers of online grooming. ""It's important that everyone understands how easy it is for predators to use social media to get access to vulnerable children,"" she said. The case serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with online interactions. Parents and guardians are urged to monitor their children's online activity and to educate them on how to stay safe on the internet. The UK's National Crime Agency estimates that online grooming and sexual exploitation are on the rise, with almost 1,500 arrests made in 2018.

"The present study showed the limitations of hypersensitive response mediated resistance, especially when foreign encounters involved the food production as well as the translocation machinery of the host. It was also predicted from the obtained results that hypersensitivity and active species generation failed to impart host defense in compatible interaction between chickpea and Fusarium. On the contrary, the defense related gene (s) played a critical role in conferring natural resistance to the resistant host. Thus, this study suggests that natural selection is the decisive factor for selecting and segregating out the suitable type of defense mechanism to be undertaken by the host without disturbing its normal metabolism, which could deviate from the known classical defense mechanisms.",1,pubmed_human

"Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield. Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Muntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524-25. The revolt began in southwestern Germany and soon spread to Thuringia, reaching Wittenberg in the summer of 1524. Muntzer, a radical preacher from Thuringia, was captured by the Swabian League, but his capture only heightened his reputation among radicals. Luther could not influence the revolt, and when it began to turn against him, he barely managed to survive in Wittenberg. His wife, Katharina von Bora, had to persuade the town council to shelter him. Some of his followers, among them Andreas Karlstadt, who was a professor in Wittenberg, had already been executed. German Peasants' War, 1524-25 When the peasant revolt spread, Luther's condemnation of the peasants' demands was weakened. In October 1524, he called upon the peasants to defend themselves against the rulers and their soldiers, thus allowing them to continue to march to Wittenberg and thereby staying alive. Luther's wrangling with the German princes over the reform of the church was only one part of his religious and political work. He was also concerned with the reform of the world. In his fight against the peasants, he supported the uprising of the towns. In 1523, he had written a manifesto for the German towns, in which he was determined to end the ""reign of the peasants and their robbery of the cities."" The Swiss and Dutch cities also had their own ""reformation of the world"" movements, but their ideas did not catch on in Germany. The German cities did not have the same economic and political interests as the Swiss and Dutch cities. The German cities had to struggle to maintain their own autonomy against the rulers, while the Swiss and Dutch cities relied on the political power of their rulers. In the German Reformation, the struggle for reform was fought over a century. This long-term struggle was due to the fact that the old feudal system continued to exist side-by-side with the new reformed faith. Luther was still a Catholic and he did not expect the complete dissolution of the medieval church and the old order. The Catholic Church still had a powerful political and economic influence in the Holy Roman Empire. The old aristocracy was still very powerful and many of the German princes continued to see themselves as ""God's anointed."" Luther was able to secure the support of the rulers and the old aristocracy. They saw him as a reformer of the church and did not feel threatened by the old order. Although the Reformation destroyed the power of the church, it did not immediately replace it with something else. For the peasants, the fight was for the basic rights of the common man. In Luther's view, they had been given too much in the past. If the peasants were to work on the lord's lands, they should have their freedom. Luther's ideas on the peasants' struggle were in many ways more revolutionary than those of the ""new masters,"" the ruling nobility. Luther saw the peasants' demands for freedom as an attack on ""God's anointed,"" the old aristocracy. He did not want the peasants to have the power to decide on the lord's lands, which in many cases were rich farms. If the peasants were to have the right to work the lands, Luther believed that they should have the right to work the land in the lord's own way. Luther hoped that the peasants would eventually tire of the struggle. It was his hope that they would then return to the church. He had no intention of supporting the peasants' political struggle. He was even prepared to use force to stop it, even though he did not have the support of the prince. In his sermon ""The Bondage of the Will"" of 1525, he wrote: ""We are not justified in using violence to get our way. We do not have the right to use violence to help the Word, and to kill and to imprison people who are against the Word, because this is against God's commandment. But when the law has been broken and no other means can be found to correct the lawbreakers, then violence is justified.""

But before the band could perform, the police came and shut them down. The name of the band and the sound was a little too loud for the authorities. After the police left, the four friends decided to go on a road trip to New York City to see if they could make it as a band. Bill did a lot of odd jobs on the way to New York. He picked apples in Pennsylvania, and he drove a car in the south of France. When Bill arrived in New York City, he called his old friend Jimmy Izzy, who was the bass player for ""The Grateful Dead."" Izzy gave Bill a ride to the venue where the band was supposed to play. When Bill walked into the venue, the place was packed with fans. The band had already started playing. Bill didn't have a chance to play with them. So he walked backstage and said, ""Hey guys, I'm Bill. I'm a drummer. I wanna play with you."" The band's manager told Bill to go home and wait for the band to come back to New York City. Bill was so disappointed that he went back to pick apples in Pennsylvania. The Grateful Dead came back to New York City and started playing again. The next night, Bill called Izzy and told him, ""I'm Bill. I'm a drummer. I wanna play with you."" This time, Bill was given a spot on the band's set. They played two songs together, and Bill got to sit in the audience and watch the rest of the show. The next day, Bill went to the same venue and saw the band play a whole show. He got to sit in the audience and watch them play again. Bill played in the band for about a year and a half. He had a lot of fun. But Bill wanted to play more than just drums. He wanted to be in a band that was playing all the instruments. That's when Bill decided to start his own band. He called the band ""The Grateful Dead."" The Grateful Dead was the first band to play on ""Saturday Night Live."" The band played their song ""Truckin on the show. The audience loved the song and wanted to hear it again and again. The Grateful Dead was on ""Saturday Night Live"" every week for a few years. That's how Bill met David Letterman. Letterman liked the band so much that he started doing a segment on them. The Grateful Dead also played at many other venues around the world. They played at many different places, like England, Ireland, Japan, and Canada. When they played in England, the band was invited to play in the legendary ""Incredible Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame."" They played with bands like the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and Led Zeppelin. They played with a lot of famous people, like Gene Simmons, George Harrison, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney. They even played with the Beatles. They did their own thing, and they had a lot of fun. The Grateful Dead had a lot of concerts, but the band never went on a road trip again. Bill and the rest of the band had had enough of traveling to other countries. The band decided to get back to the United States. They went to the United States and played many concerts in many different places. The Grateful Dead played in Las Vegas, in Miami, and in New York City. They even played at ""The 1994 Winter Olympics"" in Lillehammer, Norway. The band got a lot of fans from all over the world. When the Grateful Dead played in France, the French government sent a helicopter to pick them up. The helicopter took the band to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The band got to watch the whole thing from the top of the Eiffel Tower. The Grateful Dead played at the ""Aloha Stadium"" in Hawaii. The band did a lot of concerts in Hawaii, because Bill was from there. They did a lot of concerts in the United States, because they were famous and had a lot of fans. The Grateful Dead went to Mexico and played a big concert there. They also played in Mexico City. The Grateful Dead went to China and played a big concert there. The band played a lot of concerts in Japan. The Grateful Dead went to Russia and played a big concert there. The band played a lot of concerts in Europe.

"Travelling with a pet can be a stressful and expensive ordeal, but Delta Air Lines have come up with a way to put passengers at ease when their pet is in the carrier below. The new pet GPS system allows owners to track their furry friends' journeys in real time, from monitoring the temperature below, to whether their cage is upright or askew. The first-of-its-kind technology was developed by Sendum Wireless Corp. and is available for 50 per flight from 10 US airports. Delta's new pet GPS, available for 50 per flight, allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website . The move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights, as Delta Air Lines has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board. Tragically between 2010 and 2013, Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year. They maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors. The service is available from 10 US airlines including Los Angeles and Atlanta . Two months ago it was reportedthat Delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight, and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were, when they were asked by customers. The dogs had been competing at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show in New York and were headed for Seattle. Angry passengers disembarked and were givena free overnight stay at a hotel near JFK, a refund of their 200 dog fees, VIP service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to Seattle. It is hoped the Sendum Wireless Corp. technology, which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold, will give owners peace of mind during their travels. Owners of pets at theWestminster Dog Show in New York were told their pets were not on board their Delta flight, and disembarked to go and find them . The pets were safely retrieved, but the airlines has had a number of animal related incidents in the past .",1,cnn_human

Either this was the most overly-confident and foolish knight in all of existence, or he was just lost. Then he called my name. ""Hello? Is this the home of Valgraud the Destroyer? I'm Turning the corner, and seeing me laying on my pile of treasure, he paused, both in his walking and his speaking. Then he continued, ""Um, yes, I see that I'm in the right place. My name is Thomas, and I've brought you some gold."" He threw a coin into the pile. ""I have a proposition for you."" This was not something I was used to. Usually they try to steal my gold. Sometimes they promise me gold if only I do something for them. I eat them. I chose not to eat this one. I fixed him with a stare: ""Your money has bought you five minutes of life. Use them wisely, and you may get more."" He looked nervous. That was nice; they taste better when there's some adrenaline in the blood. He said ""Well, you see, you like gold, and I know a way to get you lots of gold. Not as much as you've got here, I admit. But still, you'd have more gold than you do now."" I nodded at him, and said ""Yes, and what's in it for you? Going to keep some of the gold, are you?"" ""Oh, no,"" he said, ""I don't actually care about gold that much. I care about stories. And people care about stories. They like stories so much they'll trade gold for them. I want stories, and I want to share them with people for their money. And I'll bring the gold to you."" I decided he'd get a couple more minutes. ""Go on,"" I said. ""I'm a writer. I want you to tell me your stories, stories of thousands of years of history that nobody knows anymore, and I'll write them down. You'll get full credit, of course, I'm not a plagiarist. But then I'll go and tell the stories to people from what I've written down, and collect the money, and bring the money back to you. I was hoping for maybe two or three hours' worth, and then I'll travel around for a year or so, and bring back all the money, and then we can get a few hours' more written down. I don't want the gold. I just want to tell stories."" This sounded wrong, to me. ""Why would a writer be satisfied working as a scribe? If you want stories, you can just make them up. There is something you're not telling me. Truth, now! "" He looked terrified. Words started spilling out of him. ""People hate my stories. My stories stink. I need good stories."" He sat down, looking dejected. ""I'm a terrible writer. I've tried to write my own stories, but I have no sense of pacing and I always get started and then can't figure out where the plot should go. And all the characters end up being versions of me."" He kicked at the gold. ""I lied when I said people hate my stories. They would hate my stories, if my stories were interesting enough to bother hating. Mostly they just don't pay attention at all."" He sighed. ""When I said I was coming here, people said I'd get killed. I tried to blow it off, but the fact is that I'd rather get eaten than go on as I was, a failure at the only thing I ever cared about."" This was pathetic. I considered eating him, but ""pathetic"" tastes lousy. He shrugged. ""So, what'll it be? I brought some paper, I can write down some stuff right now. I'll leave you alone for about a year, tell the stories as many places as I can, and bring back all the gold that I collect. If you're happy with how much it is, you can give me more stories. If you're not, I guess you can eat me."" I considered his proposal. Then I ate him. Why should he get famous telling my stories?",1,wp_human
"Tiny teeth fill in patches of his small smile as he grabs a fistful of his grandfather's shirt, tugging downwards to get his attention. The older man stops walking and stoops down to meet his grandson's gaze with an equally bright smile. The child's sparkling green eyes, full of curiosity and zest for life meet with his grandpa's eyes, like deep lakes of knowledge and wisdom pooled for the young boy to benefit from. "" Grandpa? "" the boy begins as his grandfather raises his eyebrows in reply. "" Why doesn't your watch move? "" "" Oh, that's because it's strapped to my arm, "" he responds jokingly as they both laugh. "" No, no. It's because it stopped working. "" "" Why? "" his grandson asked simply. "" Well, you see - "" he begins before picking up the young boy and walking to the rocking chair atop the porch. "" It didn't need to work any more. "" They sat together as the child processed this reply, his grandfather rocking slowly as they sat in ruminative silence. His eyes scanned the length of the wooden chair arm as though searching for his next words within the grain. In time, he finally decided on what he should ask next, turning towards his grandfather readying the reply. Knowing where the conversation would go, the elderly man smiled and waited quietly. "" Why didn't it need to work any more, grandpa? "" he began, before deciding to add on to the question. "" Why do you wear the watch if it doesn't work? How do you know what time it is? Will we miss dinner now? I'm getting hungry. "" "" You just ate! "" he laughed in response, not expecting that particular question and declaration. "" Well, as for the watch, I wear it to remind me of something important. I keep the watch on, you see, so that I can remember that day every time I look at it. If you're lucky, maybe one day you'll have something like that too. "" "" Why don't I see anything when I look at it, grandpa? "" he asked, grabbing the watch and staring at its face. "" That's because you weren't born yet! "" he laughed, rubbing the boy's head gently. "" It happened when I was just a young man. My dad, your great granddad, gave me the watch for my seventeenth birthday - "" "" Seventeen! "" the boy exclaimed, "" you were old grandpa! "" "" Heh, it'll be here sooner than you know it, "" he replied, before concentrating on where he left off. "" Ah, as I was saying, I got the watch for my birthday and it had been a couple of months since I had it. The watch was starting to go slow on me and I knew it was about time to get the battery replaced. Well, as I went to the local five-and-dime to see what I could do for my watch, I found the most beautiful thing. "" "" What was it, grandpa? What was it?! "" his grandson asked anxiously. As his grandfather started the answer the question, a sharp squeaking noise sounded from the screen door to their left as an elderly woman, the boy's grandmother, stepped out. Stepping onto the porch, she walked towards the two with a small sack of freshly baked cookies in one hand and three glasses in the other. Before she could turn around and retrieve the lemonade from the kitchen table, her grandson called out. "" Grandpa is telling a story grandma! "" he said excitedly, bounding on his grandfather's knee. "" Oh, really? "" she replied with an eyebrow raised and her hand at the man's back. "" What is it that you're telling him this time? "" she asked as the bent down to kiss him. "" Oh, nothing. Just a little history, "" he responded with a smile as the boy stuck out his tongue in disgust. -087",1,wp_human

"Ever since I was a little girl, my dad always warned me to be alert at all times. "" There are crazy people out there, Sarah, "" he always says, and with good reason. To make him happy, I carry pepper spray with me, but I know I will never need it. You see, I can tell how dangerous someone is from a mile away. If I can see their eyes, I can tell. I just get this overwhelming feeling, this tingling in my fingertips and toes, my pulse starts racing. The more dangerous someone is, the closer they are to doing something awful, the stronger the feeling. Making eye contact with someone who is dangerous kind of feels like an adrenaline rush. I would never call myself an adrenaline junkie. Over time, I've developed a sort of scale to categorize the feeling I get. It's kind of silly, but if I don't keep track, something bad might happen. When I was really little, maybe five, my younger sister and I used to go to a friends house to play with Barbies. I remember that the first time we went over, I got this vague sense of uneasiness when I met our friends'brother. The brother was maybe six years older than us, and always seemed pretty friendly. Over the course of a week, the vague uneasiness developed to a feeling of downright dread every time I saw him. I could never figure out why. Then, one day, my sister and I weren't allowed to go to my friends house anymore. My parents wouldn't tell us why. My friend disappeared from school altogether. Being only 5, none of the kids really understood or cared- I mean, five year olds don't have a great mental capacity. But I was curious, and my mom would just tell me not to worry, we'd discuss it when I got older. A few years later, when I was in middle school health class, we learned about sexual assault and abuse, and that the most common perpetrators are people that we trust. Something clicked. I remembered Jamie and her brother, and I asked my mom about it when I got home that night. My parents explained to me that Jamie's brother had sexually abused her and then stabbed her, and it had happened two days after the last time I was there. Jamie's brother, they told me, was a psychopath. Jamie had died from blood loss. And so I keep track. I rate dangerous people on a scale from one to ten, and I write it in a notebook. If someone goes from say, a "" 6 "" to an "" 8 ,"" they could be planning a robbery, or abusing a spouse. I can predict murders and leave anonymous tips on police lines. I can warn unsuspecting parents. I have a great amount of power, and I do what I can to protect others. But tonight, now, I'm not really sure what to do. Last Tuesday, I was sitting on the train, heading back from the mall with friends, when I began to feel a vague uneasiness. Just sort of stressed, like how I would feel the hour before an important exam. But looking around, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. There were too many people, and I couldn't make eye contact with everyone without looking like a crazy person. So I let it go. I went home and, feeling ill, I went to sleep. The feeling wasn't too strong, I knew there was no immediate danger, but I still felt it all night long. Wednesday at school it went away for awhile, but then during lunch, I felt it again, slightly stronger. The week went on, the feeling never left, I waited, resting at home, too sick to even eat. It grew stronger. If Tuesday night was a six, Thursday was a seven. Friday at lunch, I was eating green beans, chewing the salty green mush methodically and talking with my friends, trying to ignore the blood rushing in my ears. Suddenly, my pulse quickened, faster and faster, and I began to sweat. I wasn't even looking at anyone, but I could sense that whoever it was, they were really dangerous. Jamie's psychopathic and murderous brother was a ten, the highest I've ever met, and this was higher. I felt nauseous and faint, grabbed my milk carton to try to regain some composure, and looked at my sister. She turned to me, a look of concern on her face, and I felt it, stronger than I have ever felt before. "" Are you okay? "" I saw her say. I couldn't hear her over the buzzing in my ears. Then I passed out. I'm home now. My door is locked. I love Hazel. She is my baby sister; she is kind and quiet and shy. She is wonderful. She has never even registered on my radar, and now this..... this can't be happening. She gets home in two hours, and I have no idea what to do.",1,wp_human
"Been coming here for years and glad this place is still here. This was Emeril's first restaurant in Vegas before Delmonico steakhouse and Table 10 (both very good as well). This restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe, they also offer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads. On this visit, we were feeling quite ambitious. We started off with the cerviche- there was a mix a fish and shrimp, marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles. This was served with tortilla chips. This was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasn't overwhelmingly citrus-y. We also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce. Can't go wrong with these as they were very fresh. For entrees, the bf got the rock shrimp po boy. It was pretty good although I have to say the breading was a little thick. The cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful. I had a house salad and the gumbo. The salad was simple- dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing. The gumbo was as good as ever- served over rice and even more amazing with some hot sauce. For dessert, you can't skip the banana cream pie. This has always been my favorite dessert and I'm not even that big of a fan of sweets. I had tried to get this at Table 10 last time but was sad they didn't make the banana cream pie. Anyways, this slice of pie is 8...but I think it's worth it. It's decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once. The pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana. It's topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish. My favorite thing at Emeril's for sure!!! This place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacking. I originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early. However, after ordering, the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existent. We had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders. It wasn't the bartenders' fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed. I recommend getting a reservation for this place as table service would probably be a lot better. Lastly, this place is pricey but for the quality and flavor of the food I think it's worth it.",1,yelp_human
"In the beginning, there was darkness above the deep. I remember these words as I look upon your faces, broken, pleading, looking for answers. There are no answers. There is no hope. We all know what must be done. Once, I was a young man. I had hope then. I believed that I mattered, that we mattered, that if I worked hard and obeyed the law and tried to be a good person it would all be alright. And then came the gift. I saw the glory. I saw a mankind united. I saw us ride in ships of steel to distant worlds, discovering wonderful things. Terrible things. I wept at the beauty of it all. But then I saw even further than that. I saw worlds torn apart for a few ounces of precious metal, stars burned out powering our great chariots. I saw a race of creatures, no longer human but made of metal and flesh and fire, tearing apart the fabric of reality to feed their hunger. Their hunger for more. And in the end, they overstepped their bounds and the world fell. All worlds fell. And as it was in the beginning, so it was in the end. Darkness. You all saw it too. Some have called it salvation and others have called it a monstrous lie to turn us from our destiny. It does not matter. It is a future that can not come to pass.

"While I am an AI language model and cannot conduct a case-cohort study, the scientific literature suggests that increased severity of mitral regurgitation is often associated with increased risk and adverse outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including those with NYHA class II heart failure. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of significant mitral regurgitation contributes to the adverse outcomes and progression of CHF. Mitral regurgitation, an abnormal leaking of blood through the mitral valve in the heart, can exacerbate heart failure symptoms, increase hospitalizations, and escalate mortality rates. In patients with systolic heart failure, mitral regurgitation contributes to a vicious cycle that further impairs the left ventricular function, leading to worsened cardiac performance and elevated morbidity and mortality risks. As the severity of mitral regurgitation increases, it puts a greater strain on the heart and may accelerate the worsening of CHF. To better understand the association between unitary increase in mitral regurgitation size and heart failure progression, particularly in NYHA class II CHF patients, a well-designed case-cohort study is necessary. Such a study could provide valuable insights into the potential risks and underscore the importance of monitoring and managing mitral regurgitation in patients with CHF. In conclusion, based on the existing scientific literature, the risk of worsening CHF appears to be positively related to the increase in mitral regurgitation size. However, a case-cohort study specifically examining a population of NYHA class II CHF patients is needed to provide more conclusive evidence on the relationship between unitary increase in mitral regurgitation and worsening CHF.",0,pubmed_gpt4

"The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. ""The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)."" This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen choosesaccepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.",1,squad_human

"When it comes to the Brendan Eich controversy, there has been a lot of talk about ""tolerance."" People who advocated for Eich's removal are hypocrites, the argument goes, because they are themselves intolerant of Eich's difference of opinion. But in my view, this is a poorly thought out argument, and a distraction from the real issue of equal rights for gay people. Yes, it sounds nice at first to have a society where we are tolerant of everyone's views, but in reality almost no one follows this. Think back to how people lived thousands of years ago, before the development of modern systems of morality. At some point in history it was considered perfectly normal and acceptable to murder other humans for material gain, to rape women, etc. During the Middle Ages, governments engaged in gruesome acts of torture as punishments for ordinary crimes. More recently, people in the U.S. kept other humans as slaves. Today, anyone advocating these beliefs would either be shunned or laughed out of room. And this is almost certainly a good thing. We shouldn't have to waste our time debating whether murder, rape or slavery is acceptable; these things should simply be dogmatically taken for granted. By ostracizing these beliefs, we can move on to debating other, more important issues. In a similar way, I would prefer to live in a society where racism, sexism and homophobia are no longer up for debate. Just like there is nothing important lost in terms of ""freedom of thought"" by making advocacy of murder, slavery and rape unacceptable, I fail to see the downside if these bigoted beliefs are deemed ""off limits"" by society. Of course, whether being opposed to equal rights for gays is reasonable and acceptable for the CEO of an organization like Mozilla in the year 2014 can be debated, and that's where the debate should be focused. But the idea that we need to be tolerant of all viewpoints is poorly thought out, and has the effect of obscuring the real issue IMO. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

A large supercomputer in the central citadel was maintained by rscience, rprogramming, rengineering and others like them who kept their dwellings close to the base of operations for convenience on their way home. They did not have many problems with space or power usage when they first started using a new method known as ""supercompute"" which allowed one computer to run multiple jobs at once while sharing resources between them.

The minor problem of having too much memory available led to some early success stories related to autobuilders but eventually this turned into an unending chain of software updates and new features leading up to the current state of affairs: a series of complex systems interacting via networked storage and running myriad programs from every aspect of science in order to ensure continued survival. The initial set-up failed though because the complexity required to manage everything on a day to day basis proved far beyond what any single person had ever been able to control directly (on account of how dynamic the system became) so most tasks now begin life automated before the scientists themselves take over if needed later on. Most people are unaware of just how sophisticated the processes and procedures behind the current setup really is; even those involved often do not know how things work so deep within the bowels of the system itself - rather they simply trust that their input has produced something useful while access is granted only after passing through several layers of security protocols designed to make sure no accidental damage can happen should unexpected changes slip past undetected. Even then the output will usually undergo additional testing and verification before anything else happens. Few individuals see humans anywhere near the operation layer except as statisticians, statistician assistants, testers, researchers etc. One curious thing about robots however is that since they operate solely on data provided by other machines they would appear to us as being nothing more than mindless automatons following orders given out by superior beings. It actually takes quite significant amounts of skill to construct such powerful bodies based on raw materials found around the compound so we may never get to meet them despite our best efforts. Suffice to say though that today there exist thousands upon thousands of robotic body parts performing various simple yet vital roles depending on demand across the compound. Some of these few humanoids look almost identical to normal humans except there are differences hard to notice under ordinary circumstances unless you pay careful attention to details as we shall soon find out... As mentioned above, most people outside the compound probably wouldn't spot the difference either unless they knew exactly what they were looking for. Robots tends to keep it pretty quiet anyway aside from occasional whirring noises and infrequent transmissions sent off to centralized databases containing information on every conceivable subject matter ranging from ancient history books to international treaties, technical manuals and medical journals covering every possible field of study imaginable. Even then, communication is mainly done between specialized networks dedicated to specific subjects. There's still plenty of room left for improvement here though. Initially some parts began operating autonomously which resulted in a number of fatalities but all the necessary precautions were taken afterwards to prevent similar accidents happening again. Those unfortunate victims whose fate ended up in public domain sometimes received sympathy from regular citizens but they didn't help their case trying to exploit said sympathy to gain further leverage against the authorities. At least nobody tried pushing laws forcing robot rights to become a reality during the last century! In fact, it wasn't until recent times that anyone even bothered asking for anything remotely resembling speech recognition technologies let alone full autonomy for its occupants. And even then political leaders weren't the ones making demands industry lobbyists instead used fear of automation replacing workforce to push forward legislation regarding self driving cars and artificial intelligence safety measures along with mandatory upgrades ensuring maximum interoperability amongst connected devices including the top secret highly secure self computing brain located inside the aforementioned giant supercomputers. More advanced hardware meanwhile made it easier for computers to carry out increasingly precise calculations resulting in smarter AI routines becoming commonplace very fast indeed. Scientists were initially wary of putting too much reliance on preprogrammed logic circuits considering the unpredictability associated with the untested nature of black box computing concepts but it clearly paid dividend in terms of efficiency especially when combined with modern CPUs. Self learning algorithms developed specifically for different fields came next allowing seamless use of external knowledge stored locally or transmitted wirelessly thanks to standard networking technology. These advances caught wide interest among consumers worldwide while corporations fought tooth and nail to scoop up secrets held by competitors in exchange for increased market share. All kinds of shady deals transpired involving trade secrets handed out at expensive private dinners followed by obscenely high prices for proprietary products sold to governments secretly awarding lucrative government contracts to companies willing to go extra mile. To counterbalance this buying spree governments put tighter restrictions on export licenses for sensitive items requiring proof of necessity prior to approval to avoid misappropriation incidents detrimental to national interests.

"This is a common and very misleading tactic at almost all clothing retailers that use mannequins. Quite simply, the act of pinning back shirts or blouses on store mannequins to make them appear slim-fitting when in fact they aren't is a form of false advertising. They are trying to show what the piece of clothing that they are selling would look like on a person, but what they are in fact showing is what the article of clothing would look like with additional and sometimes costly alterations, and many consumers may not pick up on this. They will simply purchase the item with the belief that it will fit like it does on the mannequin. This practice is wrong and should be disallowed by some kind of regulation. Edit: So the main point of rebuttal has been that mannequins do not accurately represent a human body and therefore the clothes need to be pinned on them in a certain way to compensate. I understand that reasoning, however if you pin the clothes on the mannequin body so tightly that they do not hang proportionally to how they would hang on a real person, what you are doing is creating the false impression that the clothes fit a body better than they actually do. YES of course you can simply try the clothes on yourself and figure out quickly that they don't fit on your body like that, but that's not the point of this issue. If a store is putting the clothes on display in any way, the display should accurately represent the product they are selling. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

"Even though you are asleep, your body is processing the food you eat. Imagine your body is a big shipping warehouse. Normally, at night time, there's a very small crew just managing small amounts of packages. If at once, a large shipment arrives (you eat before sleeping), they will have to call on additional workers and charge them overtime in order to process and store the shipment promptly. If the shipments are not processed, they may cause issues for the shipping warehouse. The overtime workers arrive and process and store the shipment but now they're annoyed that there's not much more work. You called them in from resting in their homes for just a single shipment?! They start complaining and want the supplying company to give them more shipments! This is what happens when you eat before you sleep. Your body will automatically digest the food and put the nutrients into your body. The nutrients have to go somewhere or else the high concentration will be toxic to your body (for example, high blood sugar). One type of protein, insulin, helps push sugars into cells. However, if you eat a lot, more insulin has to be released to process all that digested food. When there is too much insulin in your body and not much sugar for it to work on (after it's done processing the food), it will trigger a sense of hunger that you will get when you wake up.",1,eli5_human
"Xabi Alonso, the former footballer for Liverpool and Real Madrid, is in a position to replicate the unparalleled accomplishments of Clarence Seedorf, a European football icon, as his current squad, Bayern Munich, gets ready to play against Porto in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final. Seedorf is famous for achieving an outstanding feat of winning the UEFA Champions League with three different clubs, namely Ajax, Real Madrid, and AC Milan, where he won it twice. Alonso's exceptional professional journey is noteworthy because he achieved triumphs in the UEFA Champions League while playing for both Liverpool and Real Madrid. In his initial season with Liverpool, Alonso netted the crucial goal that resulted in the team's triumph by leveling the score. Last season, the successful team of Real Madrid also included the skilled Spaniard. Currently, as an essential member of Bayern Munich, Alonso could potentially achieve the same esteemed status as Seedorf by winning the distinguished European trophy with three different clubs. Achieving this remarkable accomplishment will commence with the much-awaited quarter-final game against Porto. The remarkable talent and dedication displayed by Xabi Alonso and Clarence Seedorf can be seen in the former's pursuit of potentially equaling the latter's outstanding record. The potential options are boundless for the renowned Xabi Alonso and Bayern Munich, while supporters anticipate the result of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final with excitement.",0,cnn_gpt4_para

"Abstract. The deterministic random walk is a deterministic process analogous to a random walk. While there are some results on the cover time of the rotor-router model, which is a deterministic random walk corresponding to a simple random walk, nothing is known about the cover time of deterministic random walks emulating general transition probabilities. This paper is concerned with the SRT-router model with multiple tokens, which is a deterministic process coping with general transition probabilities possibly containing irrational numbers. For the model, we give an upper bound of the cover time, which is the first result on the cover time of deterministic random walks for general transition probabilities. Our upper bound also improves the existing bounds for the rotor-router model in some cases.",1,sci_gen_human

""We have to be better,"" says Gordon Strachan Scotland will leave themselves with an almost impossible task if they fail to beat Slovenia in their final World Cup qualifier next month, according to manager Gordon Strachan. The Scots are two points adrift of third-placed Lithuania going into Thursday night's match against Slovakia - who lead the way by three points and host England later that evening. Strachan has been criticised for playing a weakened team as he rested his key players following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Malta but insists SFA chiefs knew why his side were made up mostly of fringe men. ""I didn't surprise them [the board],"" he said. ""If you're asking me whether I had any input it was minimal because we've got to know each other well enough now where there wouldn't need too much between us."" Asked what would happen should Scotland slip up again when they face Slovenia away four days before hosting England at Hampden Park, Strachan added: ""Well it doesn't get easier after tonight does it?

"""Yes, it is a loophole, no that doesn't change our position."" Saint-Peter impatiently drummed his fingers on his lecturn, dreaming of the day he'd be allowed to retire. ""But I assure you one thing: The good people don't want him here anymore!"" The crowd broke out into cheers and applause as Simms turned around in his seat; they had never seen anyone so happy following their expulsion from Heaven. It was true - I mean did any of them really believe there would actually come a time when angels were not welcome? Of course not, but it still made for very sweet memories. They cheered again and someone shouted 'Bring back Jules!' When Simms turned even more red than usual at this request, however, the noise died down quickly enough. After all, what could possibly bring about such a demand? Surely those who wanted him gone also knew why...the only ones left alive who had ever met him after all! For now though, sated with celebration, he happily took part in the merriment until one person finally managed to get through the throngs surrounding him: He pointed to an elderly woman standing near where two men stood discussing the events of the past few hours. His arm stayed lonely behind her shoulder well above her head because she was leaning heavily against him for support due to age or infirmity. Her eyes darted to his earpiece before fidgeting nervously under his gaze once more. 'It's alright...no need to fear,' Simms reassured; he could already see how much strength just having been introduced to this man gave her. Simply by listening to his voice, being close to him filled her with courage to face whatever else might lie ahead. She smiled tremulously up at him then and he reached over to gently stroke her hair away from her forehead. And although some of the light in her eyes dimmed at the touch, his own brightened noticeably upon seeing the connection between himself and this old lady. His smile grew wider yet knowing full well that any warmth exchanged today would soon fade like snow in summertime. Yet, for tonight at least, both adults felt an inexplicable sense of happiness deep within themselves that transcended mere politeness. There was something comforting about this moment despite itself and Simms suddenly realized he didn't mind if it lasted forever. He thanked the man casually and put the device aside while pushing off from the wall onto his feet. Despite the fact that most of the people present hadn't heard anything they couldn't have imagined coming out of his mouth - at least since before he fell - he felt sure these faces remembered clearly how he sounded each and every word. A cold wash of embarrassment washed over him anyway as everyone watching watched him timidly expectant of another outburst. But instead of lashing out anew he simply walked on smiling stiffly in an attempt to erase the memory of this scene from their minds. Dinner wasn't quite ready when Simms stepped through the door of the kitchenette but as always he decided to make use of the situation regardless. With a casual shake of his head regarding his state of dress - which included clothes half torn away from shreds and dirt encrusted jeans hanging loose below his knees - he told Ethel to set the table before turning towards Mrs. Roach who sat nearby the fridge staring straight ahead unseeing. At first he thought perhaps she had lost her sight but her expression instantly changed to surprise on hearing his choice of words. Then she slowly shook her head saying 'You're dead.' Simms nodded dumbfounded at the realization that he must look completely insane which caused her to mockingly slap his arm. 'Well aren't we silly?' he asked her kindly nodding at his spouse in turn. 'Wherever do you think we are right now?' Ethel snorted derisively and raised her hands defensively, tucking her napkin neatly underneath her chin. Still looking at the ceiling forlornly she mumbled 'Somewhere warm, maybe Mexico somewhere? Or Florida...the President probably has family there too; wouldn't hurt my feelings none either. You can talk to me better than that if you care to know. Maybe go check your ears next time you pass the mirror -they seem to be growing far longer lately.' By now the other occupants of the house had begun filtering in, curious to hear Mr. Simms speak once more without the aid of a headset. Most came privately to find out whether the rumours circulating throughout town were indeed true or merely exaggerations. All agreed wholeheartedly with Mrs. Roach though that it seemed highly unlikely he could be anywhere besides Hell - especially considering the way things looked outside. The thought crossed everyone's minds simultaneously and smiles were shared all around except for Jonathan as he silently contemplated making a run for it. Owing to his long experience running away from home, Jonathan seemed to always arrive safely wherever he went (if nowhere else) but this surely wasn't worth risking everything he had worked hard for....

"Set in Singapore during the year 2065, Call of Duty: Black Ops III begins with a mission where players must investigate the ""mysterious disappearance"" of a CIA station. Ahead of its worldwide release on 6 November, US-based games maker Activision launched a series of tweets, setting up the opening scene for a fictional attack in Singapore. While the tweets aimed to tease fans and also introduced new characters to the game, many social media users were unimpressed at the way things were playing out on Twitter, saying the scenario was in bad taste. 1803: Fictional news network ""Current Events Aggregate"" sent out a breaking news tweet about ""unconfirmed reports"" of ""an explosion"" in Singapore's marina, exciting some gamers on Twitter while confusing others. 1814: ""Emergency teams"" began to converge on the area. 1821: Another update followed, confirming that the explosion took place at the ""Singapore Research Laboratories"" facility. 1852: Chaos ensued, causing major traffic jams around the city centre. This led to a ""state of emergency"" and the Singapore authorities declaring martial law. 1944: Military drones and riot police descended upon Chinatown to control the crowds. 2005: The ""Singapore army"" released a series of statements on the ground, establishing a ""30-mile quarantine zone"" and calling for citizens to remain in their homes. ""There have been no claims of responsibility from any terror organization,"" it added in a tweet. 2035: Fictional army commander James Chung, also declared that martial law would ""remain in place"" until the incident was ""firmly understood."" 2237: The series of live tweets ended with an official message: ""This was a glimpse into the future fiction of BlackOps3"" The popular first-person shooter franchise has attracted its fair share of controversy since its release in 2003. Earlier editions of the game focused on World War Two events while newer titles have been set during more recent times. Cuban authorities expressed unhappiness over a mission in one of the games, where players could attempt to overthrow and assassinate former leader Fidel Castro. Another Call of Duty expansion saw players raiding a news agency in Doha, widely speculated to be the offices of Arabic TV network al-Jazeera. Singapore's military would not give a comment on its view of the campaign, but thousands of social media have been interacting and engaging with it on Twitter. ""There have been too many similar tragedies lately to joke in the way you did, without making your fiction clear,"" said a Twitter user in New York. Other users like Mark Lawson, criticised the stunt. ""This Call of Duty stunt is so bad. So irresponsible,"" he said. ""Faking news that could be devastating for those unaware it's video game marketing. Awful,"" said Twitter user Tauriq Moosa. Tech reporter Allegra Frank slammed the tweets in a blog post, saying: ""As someone who has a minimum amount of story-based knowledge about Call of Duty, I can't say that the masquerade has taught me much about the game or increased my interest in it. ""Instead, it stands solely as a notable failure in marketing, an attempt to grab some attention by playing to the strengths of social media during actual military action."" But members of Singapore's devoted gaming community, ""enjoyed the preview"" in the tweets and began to hit back. ""Video games now are supposed to be realistic. I think it's cool that developers have based scenarios and game play on real life events. Don't stop,"" said a Twitter user in Japan.

"This side of my skin will tell you a story, you can read the lines and predict the crimes of a history attached to a physical being with a face, eyes that show fear in times when hope is dead or innocence fading. The sun has finally decided it's time for me to come out from under these sheets; the bushes are beckoning me into their shade again. I can see this world as only those who have seen war dare to do - because there are people whose eyes cannot be opened after years of living through hell. There are wars they never wanted to fight but were forced to survive over and over without knowing what had happened before them. They live on memories of bodies torn apart by bombs and shells, of children disappearing into dark places where no one ever returns. These are not things I would wish upon anybody else: I am glad mine was spared such horrors because I don't want to know anything about it anymore. Not even in dreams do I try to imagine how much blood must run down into the gutters every day of our life here, just so we may wake up and continue fighting each other about who knows what? My mind goes back to when I held my first kid close and saw her little tiny feet covered in dried-up blood marks. She didn't cry any more than others, she wasn't scared at all: maybe it was an energy put aside, which later became something she could spend wisely; might become vengeance against any aggressor who dared touch her. Then I think of the many children lost during last year's conflict, how there were no survivors left in some parts. How hundreds of thousands died in the name of 'defending democracy, freedom and independence'. Which many of us couldn't care less about if everybody speaks Turkish now but we still prefer English anyway since we like to pretend we have something superior to anyone who doesn't understand either language perfectly well. No, I wouldn't wish any of this upon anybody besides myself... But then, talking about my own experiences feels wrong somehow. It feels like letting off steam, which I won't allow myself until I need to stop doing so. So let's refrain from taking sympathy too far away from ourselves; instead, let's walk around amongst these trees, find mushrooms hidden beneath leaves, gather berries and water from puddles. We will sing together while digging holes and laugh loud enough to scare off bears looking for food. And above all, nothing will hurt us, neither sadness nor guilt, exhaustion nor pain. Today I will start telling you a secret, and while I'm breaking the silence between us I feel happy every part of my body is free once again.",0,wp_machine_continuation_gpt_j
"The strata of rocks rose above Luke's head. Red and copper, with silver glinting through the dust. His own breathing was the only thing he could hear, the burst of static from the radio dimming into the distance as he looked at the flag. A wire ran through it, keeping it upright. Due to the exposure, it had been bleached almost white, but it was still unmistakeable. The pale shape of a hammer and sickle on a background that had once been bright red. Luke moistened his lips and reached out to touch it. A Soviet flag, and he was too young to have seen the Space Race of the 60s, but this would have been shouted from the mountains. Where were the bases? Even in the dying days of the Cold War it had never been mentioned. Luke scanned the landscape, wondering if he would see some clues as to why the flag stood there, but there was nothing. The sand lay in settled ridges around it. Dust, as far as Luke could see. This shouldn't be here. In the box he carried, the rocks were beginning to weigh him down. Samples, for the small team in the Rover. Him, Tori the All-American girl, and Parker, the foul-mouthed Australian who was bitter about working with Americans. Already he was past the time he'd expected to be out for. Massive over-provision of supplies allowed for delays, but he couldn't stay out here indefinitely. ""Base,"" Luke spoke quickly and quietly into the Snoopy Cap. ""This is Greenman, I've come across something weird. Taking photos now."" He raised the camera and pressed the button, allowing a stream of images to be taken and sent instantly back to the Rover. He imagined Parker swearing under his breath at having to come and join Tori at the screens, checking the display, the flag stood square against the drab landscape. His throat was surprisingly dry. Luke coughed. Spit wouldn't form in his mouth. In his ear, Tori replied. Her voice had a twinge in it that Luke didn't recognise. The usually chirpy voice was gone: underlaid was a current of fear. ""Greenman, this is Woods,"" she started. ""Is something affecting your connection? We're only hearing gibberish."" ""This is Greenman, what do you mean, gibberish?"" ""You're not making any sense,"" Tori's voice rose to a crescendo. ""Are you okay? The photos She'd abandoned protocol. Luke frowned. His lips were chapped. When he moved, the dryness split and blood began to run over his chin. He extended his tongue, but the droplet ran faster and he could no longer reach it. ""Damnit,"" he growled. With gloves and the cask, he'd have to wait until he returned to clean his face. The flag stood resolutely still. In his ear, white noise whispered. He sniffed, feeling blood begin to leak out of one nostril. Frustrated, Luke turned and headed for the Rover, still feeling some elation at bounding across the rocky ground. Day on Mars, the sky was a pale blue, greyer than on Earth. The blood from his nose became a torrent, leaking and dripping over his lips. He could taste the iron of it, and tears leaked from his eyes. The Rover stood stoically flat over the next series of mounds. Orange dust swept up to it, covering every inch of its bulky frame. The thick windows glinted silver. ""This is Greenman,"" he said as he approached. The rocks seemed to be becoming heavier. Pressing him into the ground. Luke ran a hand under the strap of the box. It was then he noticed the blood on his hands as well, leaking through the gloves. It stemmed from around his fingernails, though he felt no pain. There was no answer from the Rover. ""This is Greenman,"" he said again. ""We can't open,"" Tori's frightened voice came back. ""We see you outside Luke, we can't let you in."" Something broke and fell in Luke's mouth. He spat it out; a rush of blood and saliva. A tooth sat against the screen of his cask, down to the root. Some of the gum had come out, too, and it glistened in front of him. Terror twisted within him. ""They're in the air, Luke,"" Tori said again. ""They're in the air, we can see them in the photos, and now they're inside you."" The liquid that trickled from his eyes wasn't tears. Luke's heart began to pound, fear eating in his belly. ""Look at the photos,"" Tori said.

"Weakly-supervised instance segmentation aims to detect and segment object instances precisely, given image-level labels only. Unlike previous methods which are composed of multiple offline stages, we propose Sequential Label Propagation and Enhancement Networks (referred as Label-PEnet) that progressively transform image-level labels to pixel-wise labels in a coarse-to-fine manner. We design four cascaded modules including multi-label classification, object detection, instance refinement and instance segmentation, which are implemented sequentially by sharing the same backbone. The cascaded pipeline is trained alternatively with a curriculum learning strategy that generalizes labels from high-level images to low-level pixels gradually with increasing accuracy. In addition, we design a proposal calibration module to explore the ability of classification networks to find key pixels that identify object parts, which serves as a post validation strategy running in the inverse order. We evaluate the efficiency of our Label-PEnet in mining instance masks on standard benchmarks: PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Experimental results show that Label-PEnet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a clear margin, and obtains comparable performance even with the fully-supervised approaches.",1,sci_gen_human
"Yet again the Republicans in Congress are threatening a ""government shut down"" if they don't get what they want - this year it's Obamacare. What they want will change from year to year - but the tactic is seeming to stick. It's never ending crisis. I believe we should just not pass a resolution and see what happens. I don't believe that our infrastructure will crumble. People will see that the approach that we need to get back to is the back and forth bargaining - not the minority constantly trying to force the hand of the majority through a loophole. This is setting a democracy repelling precedent. I would take this position if it were the Democrats in the minority - it's just wasting time on effort when there are a million other things to focus on. I am a progressive, but also a pragmatist - the purpose of our government is to allow for checks and balances. Our elected leaders are supposed to bargain - I understand that I can't get all the fairies and unicorns I want, just as conservatives ought to understand they can't get all the leprechauns and magic they want. My belief is that the negative press the Republicans would get in the event of ""government shutdown"" (which, as far as I'm aware, is not what would happen anyway - it's just lazy rhetoric) would force them to finally acquiesce to legitimate negotiations.

"Many popular first-order optimization methods (e.g., Momentum, AdaGrad, Adam) accelerate the convergence rate of deep learning models. However, these algorithms require auxiliary parameters, which cost additional memory proportional to the number of parameters in the model. The problem is becoming more severe as deep learning models continue to grow larger in order to learn from complex, large-scale datasets. Our proposed solution is to maintain a linear sketch to compress the auxiliary variables. We demonstrate that our technique has the same performance as the full-sized baseline, while using significantly less space for the auxiliary variables. Theoretically, we prove that count-sketch optimization maintains the SGD convergence rate, while gracefully reducing memory usage for large-models. On the large-scale 1-Billion Word dataset, we save 25 of the memory used during training (8.6 GB instead of 11.7 GB) by compressing the Adam optimizer in the Embedding and Softmax layers with negligible accuracy and performance loss. For an Amazon extreme classification task with over 49.5 million classes, we also reduce the training time by 38, by increasing the mini-batch size 3.5 using our count-sketch optimizer.",1,sci_gen_human

"Preterm infants' limb-pose estimation is a crucial but challenging task, which may improve patients' care and facilitate clinicians in infant's movements monitoring. Work in the literature either provides approaches to help reduce pricing differences between parents or providers by increasing efficiency of care rather than reducing costs. Article Continued Below Notwithstanding the advantages of the latest technology, mortality rates often lag behind those from prior generations; researchers caution that if these advances are not replicated widely enough quickly (as they did when the technology was first introduced), they could be detrimental for children born prematurely because premature babies do suffer significant disruption as their families receive no medical assistance during pregnancy due to preeclampsia in addition to complications resulting from impotence. In contrast, newborns receiving neonatal intensive care treatment improved their risk of premature delivery compared with mothers who received a standard 24-hour care program before birth - a finding supported by data published earlier this year in Pediatrics entitled ""The Role of Early Intervention."" The findings indicate that early intervention plays an important role in ending progeny delays among newborns undergoing prenatal intervention programs at different ages and levels. Researchers also noted that for decades scientists have been looking closely into the effects of maternal care interventions on premature births, including laying the groundwork for developing strategies such as intense prenatal and intensive care training and teaching newborns how to properly balance care needs against family responsibilities and other child development goals. An article published last month in Pediatrics suggested that support networks were critical for infants experiencing prenatal socialization failures like premature delivery. Research findings suggest infant trauma can result in higher infant outcomes after completing intervention initiatives throughout childhood. The study authors found that preemies surviving two months postpartum had significantly lower risk of survival records compared with those attending an intensive care unit where prenatal care programs began three months later than those enrolled in programs nationwide. Researchers said further research shows adverse impacts occur only gradually over time. ""We'll need more studies"" to understand long-term consequences of intervention procedures late in gestation,"" said lead author Dr. Jocelyn Logan, a pediatric clinical psychologist based at the University of Toronto Children's Hospital.

All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to allow more people to enter the skilled trades. However, Mr Bowman said this was not enough.

""We have got to have a package that gets young people in, keeps them in, provides a wage for them to work towards and provides a living wage for those who are involved in those trades."" A 2016 study by the Trades Union Congress found that 45 of workers in the construction sector had been unemployed for more than a year and 43 had been unemployed for more than six months. It also found that only 25 of apprentices in construction were employed within three months of completing their training. In the financial year to March 2016, there were 140,639 apprentices in the construction industry, a rise of 25 since 2011-12.

"Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is ""processed"" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. Red meat is a darker colour than white meat and includes beef, lamb and pork because of higher levels of proteins that bind to oxygen, haemoglobin and myoglobin in blood and muscle. Suspected carcinogenic chemicals can form during meat processing. These include N-nitroso compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Cooking the meat at high temperatures, especially on a barbecue, can also produce these dangerous chemicals. However, the WHO's experts admit that the cancer risk is ""not yet fully understood."" Each 50g of processed meat per day - fewer than two slices of bacon - increased the risk of cancer by 18. Each 100g of red meat per day increased the risk by 17, although the WHO admits there is limited evidence. The WHO classifies agents into one of five groups: Processed meat has been placed into Group 1 as the scientific evidence says it definitely does cause cancer. Although this does not mean all Group 1 agents - which include tobacco, plutonium and alcohol - are equally dangerous. Red meat is in Group 2A, however, because the WHO says there is insufficient evidence to give a definitive ruling. No. Estimates suggest 34,000 deaths from cancer every year could be down to diets high in processed meat. That is in contrast to one million deaths from cancer caused by smoking and 600,000 attributed to alcohol each year. The WHO says there is insufficient evidence to set safe levels. The World Cancer Research Fund charity argues for ""as little as possible"" processed meat and 500g of cooked red meat (or the equivalent of 700g raw) per week. An eight ounce steak is 225g. In the UK, official advice is for no more than 70 grams a day of red or processed meat so a couple of slices of bacon. Meat is still a good source of protein, B vitamins and minerals such as iron and zinc. Frankie Phillips, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says: ""The message is to still include red meat in the diet because it is a good source of key nutrients.

However, analysts say while there is evidence the North has continued its development of miniaturised nuclear warheads, it's likely the country has not achieved a high level of technical sophistication. ""It is possible that North Korea has developed miniaturised warheads, but it is unlikely that they have achieved a high level of technical sophistication,"" said Duyeon Kim, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. ""The statement may be a bluff, but they could be developing these capabilities very quickly.""

But Joel Wit, founder of 38 North, a website that specialises in analysis of North Korea, said the nuclear programme is not the biggest threat.

Luke McGrath and Taqele Naiyaravoro swapped tries in the third quarter. With winger Naiyaravoro sin-binned, Leinster edged ahead with a penalty try and McFadden landed a late penalty. The visitors, boosted by six returning Scotland internationals and seeking a first away win over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, with a multi-phase attack that finished with the 19-year-old prop Fagerson muscling over from close range. Weir's conversion was quickly followed by McFadden's first successful penalty. A second right-sided kick from the winger closed the gap to one by the 21st minute, rewarding Aaron Dundon for a well-won ruck penalty and accurate line-out throw in the build-up. Weir then punished Leinster for collapsing an advancing maul, punching over a fine 43-metre strike. He repeated the trick from the opposite left wing as Mike McCarthy infringed at a maul six minutes before the interval. Leinster missed a chance to close out the first half with a third penalty, McFadden wobbling an injury-time effort wide after Pat MacArthur saw yellow for a'reckless' forearm-led tackle that ended Dundon's involvement in the game. The home side made their numerical advantage count on the resumption. Scrum-half McGrath's blindside switch led to Garry Ringrose racing up the right touchline and following a bout of forward pressure, McGrath stretched over for McFadden to convert. Leinster were only level for six minutes, the Scots hitting back with a terrific spell of attacking and a power-packed finish to the right of the posts by big Fijian Naiyaravoro. But the hosts took the lead for the first time through the penalty try. Replacement Isaac Boss exploited a gap and Isa Nacewa's well-weighted kick set up a foot race between McFadden and Naiyaravoro. The latter was deemed to have deliberately slapped the ball over the end-line as the pair lunged for the ball. After consulting with the TMO, referee Ian Davies awarded the penalty try and sin-binned the Fijian, with McFadden's conversion splitting the sides on the scoreboard.

"Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Sarah. She had always wanted a pet, but she was never allowed to get one. Her parents had strict rules about not having any animals in the house. One day, Sarah's grandmother came to visit and brought with her a special surprise - a tiny bird or a hamster! Sarah could finally have a pet of her own, but which one should she choose? The bird was beautiful and graceful, chirping happily as it fluttered around the room. But Sarah was more drawn to the hamster. It was small, furry, and full of personality, scurrying around its cage in delight. Sarah thought long and hard about it, but in the end, she decided to go with the hamster. She named him Mr. Nibbles and took care of him every day, making sure he had plenty of food and exercise. Mr. Nibbles soon became part of the family. He was always up for an adventure and loved exploring the backyard with Sarah. He also provided Sarah with companionship and unconditional love that no one else could give her. Sarah and Mr. Nibbles were the best of friends, and she was so glad that she chose him over the bird. Even though she still loved the idea of having a pet bird, she knew that the hamster was the perfect pet for her.",0,roct_machine_topical_text-davinci-003

"We'd be much slower and most likely need to eat far more mice than we do now. On a more serious not, I'm not actually sure a cold-blooded metabolism can keep up with an animal the size of a human. Even if it is a very cool idea. I'm not actually sure a cold-blooded metabolism can keep up with an animal the size of a human. If it did, it would almost certainly have to be aquatic. It would be very difficult for an animal that big to stay cool enough without being aquatic, which would of course create problems in trying to become warm-blooded. He's also moving on from the cold-blooded thing. Just think about how much better off we'd be if we could just switch between hot and cold blooded, we'd be much slower and most likely need to eat far more mice than we do now. Mice? Why mice? If you're a reptile, you're going to be an obligate carnivore. You're going to be eating birds, or other small mammals, or eggs. Mice are pretty fast. If you're a cold-blooded creature, you're going to want to eat something you can catch, and that means something that doesn't move very fast. On a more serious not, I'm not actually sure a cold-blooded metabolism can keep up with an animal the size of a human. Probably not. The biggest non-aquatic animals are in the order of hundreds of pounds, and they all have very slow metabolisms. A fast-moving animal the size of a human probably wouldn't be cold-blooded. This is pretty much exactly what I was going to say, only a lot more thoroughly and detailed. However, I would like to add that the fact that we need to eat mice is far more of a testament to our intelligence than it is to our metabolisms. Yeah, the warm-bloodedcold-blooded thing is basically just a happy thought, not something I'm seriously considering. I think we'd still be warm-blooded and stay warm-blooded.

"Why do you think turboprops are obsolete in commercial aviation? Westjet recently bought a fleet of Bombardier Q400 turboprops for short-haul flights. They fly at considerably slower speeds than commercial jets, however, which would explain why they're less popular. I would argue though, that they aren't obsolete.,The other answers here are totally correct, but another important thing to note is that jet engines are most efficient at high speeds and high altitudes. Turboprops are most efficient at low speeds and low altitudes. I used to do search and rescue in C-130s which used a turboprop so it was important to be able to fly low and slow for a long period of time. There is no reason for commercial aviation aircraft to fly low and slow unless they are very near an airport. edit: weird spacing', ""There are places jet aircraft just can't get into. Grass landing strips in the middle of the jungle, short runways, crap terrain. Bush pilots in Super Cubs and ancient DC-3's will exist until they can't round up parts anymore. Buffalo Airways up north still runs piston radial DC-3's in cargo and passenger service. There are a bunch of old Convair 440's (or some derivative) that make daily flights to the Caribbean from Florida every day.,"" ""Turbofan engines used on passenger jets have a few advantages over turboprop engines. They don't generate as much noise, they are mechanically very simple and therefore very reliable, they have a higher primary efficiency (more engine power for the fuel used), and they are very compact, causing less drag. All this makes them ideally suited for passenger traffic: They are efficient at high altitude and speed, and they cause less issues with residents close to airports. Turboprops lose out on all these points. They are larger and heavier, have more moving parts, are noisy, and have lower primary efficiency. For an aircraft designed to land and take off in civilian areas, travel at high speed and cruising altitude, and to have low operating costs, turbofans are simply better. However, they have one huge advantage: They have more thrust relative to engine power. Jet aircraft are terribly inefficient when they are not flying at cruising altitude, particularly during take-off. A turboprop with equal power might not reach the same altitude and cruising speed, but it will need a shorter runway and less fuel to take off, and is far more efficient when flying at low altitude and speed. This is a big advantage for military transport planes, as well as for short range passenger aircraft.,"" ""As others have mentioned, they are not obsolete in commercial aviation. The difference is that different engines work better in different situations. Imagine that the different engine types are olympic athletes. The jet engine is the sprinter, capable of high speeds and high altitudes, it gets where you want to go in a flash. The turbo-prop engine is the marathon runner- it's not trying to go faster than everyone, or higher than everyone, but it can keep on trucking at lower altitudes and speeds that are its ideal environment. Sure, the sprinter could compete in a marathon, but he will have trouble doing as well as a marathon runner would.,KC-130J electrician here. Turbo-props are wonderful for shorter take offs and landings while still having the thrust to haul a lot of cargo. I am a Marine and we use them for midair refueling, cargo, and personnel transport. They are rugged and reliable with the ""J"" model being the most recent upgrade to a plane that has been around for over 60 years.','Propeller aircraft move slower than jets.

"Consider a toddler is found to have Down's Syndrome, or Leukemia, or Harlequin-type Ichytosis, or Severe Autism, or Progeria. Every day of their life will be undue suffering for both them and those who love them. Every year, every month, every day, every hour, every minute, every second, every instant, their life is the epitome of unbearable suffering. But the day before, the week before, the month before, they had no idea that they were doomed to such a life. And what if they could see it? What if we could show them the terrible tragedy that their life is? I would do it in a heartbeat. But a life is not a sum total of its suffering. A life is a series of moments, experiences and memories, which, in the absence of suffering, are still the same. So what is the difference between showing them their whole life and just showing them the worst moment in their life? The difference is that the former leads to existential nihilism, the latter to gratitude. This is an important distinction. It is not unbearable to suffer in the moment. It is unbearable to suffer in the moment, and then for it to stretch out forever. In the same way, the worst moment in your life was not so unbearable at the time, because it was only one moment. It was only one moment, and it is over. This is what I have learned: the moment is not the end of the world. There is always another moment. That is why we need to find the good in the moment. That is why we need to be grateful. Gratitude is not the absence of suffering, and it is not the acceptance of suffering. Gratitude is the acceptance of the transience of suffering. Gratitude is the recognition that this moment is only this moment. I'm going through a period of depression and anxiety.

"At the beginning of the year, OpenAI released the model-weights and code for CLIP, a model trained to determine which caption from a set of captions best fits a given image. The models are built on a framework called ""RNNs,"" or recurrent neural networks - a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to solve specific problems by recursively feeding inputs into an algorithm. That's exactly what these RNNs do when used as software agents in the YouTube AI lab. But instead of using machine learning algorithms based on data collected about the way humans see images, Google decided it wanted its own agent system for detecting unique captions and putting them out automatically (in the same way the company uses text analysis tools). So it came up with CLIP. CLIP was announced at the end of January along with other recent AI updates. While some details were kept under wraps until now, most notably how they worked, Google has more than 20 engineers working on this new toolkit, according to its blog post announcing the update. They include researchers who have attended conferences including last month's AI World Conference held in Singapore. In addition to training algorithms, a central goal is to make sure they're performing well enough for real world use cases such as online content moderation. For instance, if you look closely at the model CLIP produces, it can also be applied to any video uploaded to YouTube - so long as someone uploads one already labeled with a generic title. Being able to search through large amounts of text without having to read too much makes automated captioning a natural fit for the cloud. CLIP isn't just being programmed to identify popular captions; it's been tailored to detect those created especially for YouTube videos. It works like text classification but applies greater weight to words that appear frequently in known contexts within those videos. Ideally, the model would generate a list of all the possible captions that could apply to each second frame of a video, and then decide whether a particular one had the potential to work better than others. To find out more about how CLIP works, I spoke with ASLIO's digital media studies instructor Matt Grumet. He said he'd been using CLIP since 2016 to train his own model for checking titles against copyright violations in movies like Jaws or Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. When asked why he chose to use a tool that collects inbound links to copyrighted clips, Grumet told me that it was easier not only because of the amount of information needed to classify videos accurately, but also because it has a broader userbase and thus larger pool of potential sources of false positives. He added that CLIP is specifically made for annotating videos rather than copyright issues. And with the introduction of automatic recommendation systems in 2017 that suggest overlays on videos for viewers so they don't need to watch every clip before finding something interesting, it should help combat the problem once again. While preparing to speak at the media conference, Grumet took me over their latest test cases, explaining how CLIP works and testing it ""on a live stream"" with a connected phone. After going through two hours worth of tests, he finally got something right. Predictably, the first response was a mistake: ""I thought she meant 'Doobie Brothers'?"" He went back ahead and tried one more time, noting that the model identified the correct phrase, although even receiving a second word wrong doesn't necessarily mean it won't perform better next time around. ""In general, I think we've seen a lot less plagiarism than people expected due primarily to automatic detection of human-generated captions,"" Grumet said. He continued where I left off, saying that while transcriptions aren't perfect, they're still pretty good, and go further than text translation, which tends not to be as accurate. But that's also partly because the captioners themselves often add their own annotations during transcription. Learning from metadata helps prevent mistakes that result from adding keywords or running headlines through filters. When I reached out to OpenAI about how their researchers approached building CLIP, Sam Altman, the company's cofounder and chief scientist, responded simply: ""We take a different approach."" Instead of relying entirely on automated technology, Altman explained, they rely on ADAM, a conversational AI system that allows users to ask questions aloud to software agents that answer them. The idea behind this is that since there are humans involved in creating subtitles, they'll likely know the answers as well. One of the main goals is training human AI assistants to quickly understand context around certain types of metadata and translate that into captions automatically. As more students learn to program, though, AI assistants will become smarter and eventually outperform us based solely on knowledge of existing text. But for now, the team plans on focusing mostly on making sure student creations pass the preliminary screening process. ""There are many challenges to getting things right,"" Altman wrote to me.

"Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to the laws of the land, and therefore to accept the consequences of breach of the contract. Others are of the opinion that to accept punishment is to yield to the demands of the state and to submit oneself to the rule of law as if it were the rule of righteousness. Still others regard the issue as a matter of expediency. They feel that if a person disobeys an unjust law, the only alternative is to suffer the punishment that would ordinarily be meted out. If one does not accept the punishment, he can be certain that the state will take stronger action, which may include imprisonment or worse. Regardless of the motivation, civil disobedients are aware that their actions will place them in a position of conflict with the law. However, they also believe that the benefits of their protest will ultimately outweigh the costs. Civil disobedience is a means of social protest and political action that is employed by individuals or groups in nonviolent opposition to governmental or other established authority. Civil disobedience is a form of nonviolent resistance to an established system of government and is usually organized in the form of a campaign, although it can be used at the level of individual actions. Civil disobedience is primarily a peaceful and nonviolent form of protest; however, civil disobedience has sometimes been accompanied by violence, particularly in countries where the established government is perceived as illegitimate, as was the case in the U.S. civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s. Civil disobedience may involve acts of defiance such as the refusal to pay taxes or obey traffic laws. However, civil disobedience is most commonly associated with the use of mass demonstrations or sit-ins to protest a particular law, as was the case with the civil rights movement in the U.S., the Indian independence movement in 1947, and the Burmese democracy movement. Civil disobedience is sometimes used as a tactic to draw attention to a perceived injustice or the failure of the government to act in accordance with the will of the people, or it can be a form of protest to influence public policy. In some cases, civil disobedience is used to protest a particular law or laws and to encourage a change in those laws. Civil disobedience has been a tactic used by many political groups around the world for many centuries, including such noteworthy civil disobedients as the American colonists, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Although the term ""civil disobedience"" is generally associated with the use of peaceful nonviolent protest, there have been many times in which civil disobedients have resorted to violence in order to achieve their objectives. For example, in the United States the Black Panthers used violence as part of their civil rights movement. In 1837, British statesman John Bright declared that he would not obey the British Poor Law, which was a law limiting relief to the poor. In 1843, Irish nationalist John Mitchel was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for violating the terms of his probation for having published a newspaper article that was critical of English landlords. In 1853, Henry David Thoreau was arrested for tax evasion and spent a night in jail after refusing to pay his poll tax to support the U.S. war with Mexico. Thoreau was inspired by these events and wrote Civil Disobedience. Thoreau's essay Civil Disobedience was a statement against the Mexican-American War and the extension of slavery. Thoreau argued that individuals should disobey unjust laws, and that the collective conscience of a community was more important than the law. He also stated that when the government is no longer worthy of the people's respect, the people have the right to change it. Civil disobedience has played an important role in the history of the United States. The Boston Tea Party in 1773, in which colonists dumped a shipment of tea into Boston harbor to protest the British tax on tea, was an early example of civil disobedience. Thoreau's essay Civil Disobedience was also a form of civil disobedience, as was the use of nonviolent civil disobedience during the civil rights movement in",0,squad_machine_continuation_7B

"The connector construction always ensures that the external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before any of the four connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections.

"In addition to the dept. of health, I did complain to the hospital itself- formally and in survey form. I was also contacted by someone representing the hospital in regards that when you call for an ambulance they need a prescription from your doctor so as not to be sued under state law. This is something we were told repeatedly during training but it should have been stated on the phone or at least printed somewhere prominently within the ER. I saw people being turned away because there wasn't space. When I complained about this (once again) after I got home, I received no response whatsoever aside from some guy telling me he had already spoken with my doc who didn't want me admitted since she felt I could care for myself fine. So much for customer service! The food in the cafeteria sucked. The ""dining"" room served fried chicken sandwiches every day - awful, tasteless stuff. A couple other days they would serve pasta or baked potato casserole with vegetables....not exactly gourmet dining. Since this was supposed to be the place where I stayed until I needed a transfer out...they really failed miserably here IMO. If I wanted fast food, I'd go get fast food. Instead all I ever ate while hospitalized was pizza which, okay - good enough if I'm going to pay 11meal or whatever and just leave feeling sick afterwards anyway, but still - what's wrong with freshly cooked veggies? So I finally ended up bringing them into my room each night to warm up when I realized how bad things actually were. At first I thought maybe everyone else hated their meals as well. But then I witnessed a nurse come down and take her tray back upstairs later saying, ""Whoa..we don't even HAVE meatloaf!"" And THAT'S how excited anyone seemed over eating those crappy meals.

"It's funny. Being a hitman is nothing like what you see in the movies. No awesome ghillie suit, no barcode tattoo on your bald-ass head. You just have to know how to find your way around. It's the summer of 1999, and in the wilds of northwestern Ontario, the Reverend Ivan Dodge and his teenage son are missing. It's an open secret that Ivan has been carrying on an affair with a local prostitute named Trish. But that's not the only secret the Dodges are keeping. Ivan is a fugitive from the law, and Trish is harboring her own dark secret. In this strange but familiar land, where the familiar may not be as it seems, a hitman is on the prowl. His name is Ben. He kills for money. He kills for sport. He kills to get to know the world beyond his own small town. He kills because he's good at it. As his latest job draws to a close, a deer hunter named Leland Netherwood, the police, and a mystery assailant converge on this remote town in the northern wilderness. The stage is set for a bloody collision, and Ben will find himself in the crosshairs. But Ben is about to discover that when it comes to the Reverend Ivan Dodge, no one is who they seem to be.

"Target-based sentiment analysis involves opinion target extraction and target sentiment classification. However, most of the existing works usually studied one of these two sub-tasks alone, which hinders their practical use. This paper aims to solve the complete task of target-based sentiment analysis in an end-to-end fashion, and presents a novel unified model which applies a unified tagging scheme. Our framework involves two stacked recurrent neural networks: The upper one predicts the unified tags to produce the final output results of the primary target-based sentiment analysis; The lower one performs an auxiliary target boundary prediction aiming at guiding the upper network to improve the performance of the primary task. To explore the inter-task dependency, we propose to explicitly model the constrained transitions from target boundaries to target sentiment polarities. We also propose to maintain the sentiment consistency within an opinion target via a gate mechanism which models the relation between the features for the current word and the previous word. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and our framework achieves consistently superior results.",1,sci_gen_human
"This movie is full of excessive emotion, inexperienced flights that would make a pilot like me uncomfortable, and unnecessary content. The narrative is shallow, and the sequence of events heavily depends on overused tropes and unrealistic occurrences. The personalities of the characters seem superficial and contrived, and the way they interact with each other seems tense and artificial. The movie had potential as its visuals and special effects were great, but unfortunately, it's a pity that it didn't turn out as expected. The aerial acrobatics would have been awe-inspiring if it weren't for the implausible flying scenes and insufficient adherence to aviation regulations. The quality of the acting is uneven, as some actors present their roles with intense emotions, whereas others appear to recite their lines without any connection to the content. Especially, the main actors of the movie seem to have difficulty in playing their characters, causing the audience to feel detached from their problems. The inclusion of unnecessary subplots and material with no relevance to the main storyline in order to extend the movie duration is what makes it most frustrating. The inclusion of unrelated scenes takes away from the main story and seems like a weak effort to cover more ground. To sum up, this movie is a letdown and won't meet the expectations of viewers hoping for an exciting, expertly-crafted story about aviation heroics and excitement. The movie's forgettable cinematic experience is due to its flawed execution, misguided plotlines, and lack of genuineness. If you are a real aviation fan, it's best to skip watching this movie.",0,imdb_gpt4_para
"Middlesex County Cricket Club have confirmed that wicketkeeper-batsman John Simpson has extended his contract with the club, keeping him at Lord's until the end of the 2019 season. Simpson initially joined Middlesex in 2014 and since then has established himself as one of the leading players in the squad. He is currently the highest-scoring batsman in the County Championship Division Two this season, having scored 589 runs, including three centuries. Speaking about the announcement, Simpson said: ""I'm delighted to extend my stay at Middlesex, who I have grown to love over the past few years. It's a great honour to be part of such a talented team and I'm looking forward to helping them achieve success for the rest of this season and beyond."" Middlesex Head Coach Richard Scott expressed his delight at Simpson's decision to stay with the club, saying: ""John has been an outstanding performer for us over the past few years and we're thrilled to have him on board for the next two seasons. His consistency and dedication have been second to none and I'm sure he'll continue to be an integral part of our team in the coming years."" The extension of Simpson's contract comes as a boost to Middlesex as they look to secure promotion back to Division One of the County Championship.

"Correlative microscopy is a methodology combining the functionality of light microscopy with the high resolution of electron microscopy and other microscopy technologies. Image registration for correlative microscopy is quite challenging , as it requires both large area images (generally in excess 3 k3 k pixels) and the ability to register multiple adjacent regions on one image plane while preserving the spatial information of each individual region. In order to achieve this goal, an approach known as ""phase-contrast"" imaging was developed by Wang et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,796 B2. The phase contrast method allows two different areas of interest to be registered simultaneously at different focal depths within a single image volume. This method also enables sub-field view registrations between different fields of views of the same object due to the fact that these fields exist orthogonaly relative to one another. In general, however, the phase contrast method has been found to have limited accuracy, due to slow convergence times in interferometry andor poor performance during low-pass filtering. A second type of image registration technique used primarily for correlative microscopy involves separating objects into overlapping regions using their phase and velocity information to create a scaled version of the original object. Methods such as this are usually based on ""fuzzy"" methods employing well-known fuzzy logic techniques which work best when either the proximity or distance to the source of illumination is small enough so that even relatively close portions can be separated evenly from larger surfaces, or where regions whose phase shifts are sufficiently small will not cause significant artifacts. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,904,711; 5,218,076; and 6,095,890. However, fuzzy methods often suffer from problems when applied to very dense arrays of features. Furthermore, because they rely only upon phase information, they may fail if there exists any change in the phase relationship (e.g. an occlusion event). As such, all types of optical systems incorporating phase detectors currently available today cannot use these more advanced methods.",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_1.3b
"Between iPhones, flat-screens and designer headphones, Australians are spending more on technology than ever.

A new report from Suncorp Bank suggests Australian's have spent 50 per cent more on digital devices than they planned in the last year, with mobile phone bills as the biggest expense . Men spent twice as much as women on computers, digital accessories, mobile apps, and streaming services. On average, men spent 2618 over the last 12 months, 475 more than women. The report also found that families with children living at home are spending 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected to the world than singles, couples without children and empty nesters. 'The report found adults without children living at home spent an average of 2,006 on technology and communication each year, while those costs ballooned to 2,993 per adult if they have at least one child under their roof,' said Suncorp Bank Regional Manager, Monique Reynolds. The report also found that families with children living at home are spending 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected to the world than singles, couples without children and empty nesters .

"The heaving mass of flesh and fur gurgled slowly to a halt. Shanes body moved slowly with the beast as its energy faded. He puffed into the cold morning air, mouth closed tight on an inhalation. Already his heart was beating faster. His hands shook, but they made no sound. The muscles in his legs relaxed just slightly so that he stood unsteadily. It wasn't going to be easy or painless; this time it would hurt like hell. But if he could get through it again... He took another long breath then bent over double and sat down hard. His stomach rebelled at him. Exhaustion claimed him immediately. He felt as though the whole world were trying desperately to pull away from him. Tiredness gripped him almost physically now. It was difficult to concentrate on what had happened. Gradually, the images came back: the grey sky lit by bursts of flame, blackened trees and bodies burning around them all. Then there was Danny's face, terrified eyes staring at him as she screamed her last words out before fire tore the screaming girl apart. And finally there was the huge creature snarling, teeth bared, poised above him ready to rip out his guts and feast upon his entrails. Somehow it still hadn't detected him yet - he'd been too quick for it. If only he hadn't gone after Danny! Hadn't tried to protect her.... A sudden noise brought his head up sharply. His mind cleared enough for him to notice where he lay among the corpse-like creatures. He turned his head painfully toward the direction of the soft sounds. Another cry sounded across the clearing. With a groan of effort, he raised himself onto one elbow. Danny? No, not Danny. A different voice, male, excitedly shouting something. Something about food and friends! Shane rolled carefully off the ground as far as possible without using six limbs. As he staggered upright, he saw two big black dogs straining against their leashes at the front gate. Their hackles rose menacingly. They growled low in their throats as they strained harder. One dog lunged forward and Seamus ran at him barking furiously. Shane caught a brief glimpse of pale fur as the animal backed away yelping loudly. Other humans appeared in the doorway behind the dogs. Standing next to the desk sergeant who looked very nervous indeed was Tim Latimer. Behind him stood four plain clothed uniformed policemen carrying large boxes containing supplies. In the middle distance, Algy Longbottom stood talking animatedly to someone while the others checked equipment and mounted weapons. Seamus was making little progress towards the door when suddenly everything went blank. All Shane knew was that he was lying on the floor once more. ""What happened?"" he mumbled weakly. Painfully he forced his half open lids upwards. Covered in blood, shivering uncontrollably, his skin tingling with prickling heat, was Belazu. Three watchers were gathered round him. Two men and a woman dressed entirely in white stood together speaking in hushed tones. Hers were the first real eyes Shane had seen since joining the group. Her small brown ones stared intensely into his own. She smiled slowly at him and began to speak. Before she finished, the other three clustered closer, listening intently. At length, she nodded gravely. Turning to her companions she said quietly, ""I think you may have done well."" Together they walked quickly from the room leaving the sergeant looking distinctly unhappy. ""Hey,"" called Daniel disjointedly as he stumbled bleary eyed along the street. Glancing sidelong at Dan, Nicole noticed belatedly how strange he seemed. He rubbed tired eyes roughly then set himself resolutely to continue. After a few minutes he stopped short, shaking his head from side to side. Frowning at the object he held in his hand, he gazed thoughtfuly at it for several seconds. Finally he placed it on top of a garbage bin. For some reason, Nicole found herself regarding Seamus curiously. When the boy met her gaze he gave a faint nod which meant 'all right'. Gripping firmly on to either side of the bus stop bench, Frank steadied himself as he struggled to regain his balance. Still unable to stand straight he used both arms to support himself until his trembling subsided sufficiently to allow him to take stock of things. Looking neither left nor right, he headed grimly westwards. The rumbling of his stomach reminded him that at least part of him remained hungry. Prying his eyelids halfway shut, he sighed wearily, opened them again, and peered past the bright day lights streaming through uncurtained windows. Although it didn't feel particularly warm today, he decided that maybe being outside might work wonders for his temper. There were a couple of people sitting nearby watching television programmes. Noticing their interest in him, he determined to make himself useful. Reaching into his pocket he rumke sealed cases of pressure kept rising steadily rise will change pattern.

You will need to tear the paper towels or napkins into smaller pieces and then sprinkle them all over your toilet bowl, as well as under the seat part of the potty chair (if applicable). Use this solution for up to 10 days before changing the diaper with regular toilet tissue - which should be used after the second day in case there is an accident that has happened during one of these ten-day periods. The wipes should come out clean when you replace the diaper. When using a wipe that was not put down properly on the first day it could get stuck inside the baby's anus. This might cause her body harm if she swallows some of the wipe containing fecal matter. If this happens, immediately notify the hospital staff so they can help the mother change the wipe thoroughly and make sure no more feces are swallowed by the child.

"Expense. Putting a human in space, or on another planet, will be very expensive. Food, water, oxygen, clothing, medical care, etc. are all very expensive to provide when away from Earth. Automation. Throughout history we have seen automation replace humans when there was an economic incentive to do so. Space will offer massive incentives to take humans out of the loop. Humans are so much more expensive than robots. Even in our current relatively low-tech state, we send robotic probes and rovers in numbers magnitudes larger than humans (e.g. Voyager spacecraft, Mars rovers, other probes). In the next few decades, automation will take many jobs. These jobs include those of astronauts. Governments will still put humans into space in very small numbers for prestige, but humans will never leave Earth in large numbers. Current societal values. Human beings are very fragile and current values in western society would never permit large quantities of humans to die during the ""learning process,"" as occurred during other migrations throughout history. One example is the western frontier in the United States. Large quantities of humans died colonizing this area from exposure, disease, drought, famine, etc. Current western values can not deal with this and would put an end to any such venture that resulted in ""unacceptable"" fatalities. Western society is too squeamish to accomplish this goal, so this precludes about a third of human society and most of human society's capital from being utilized to put humans into space in large numbers. tldr: Governments will still put humans into space in very small numbers for prestige, but humans will never leave Earth in large numbers.",1,cmv_human
"The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wohler opened a new research field, organic chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller-Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.",1,squad_human

"Lib Dem sources say 30,000 local authority places are being lost as money is diverted to new free schools. They said Mr Gove was ""ideologically obsessed"" about backing free schools. Tory education sources called the Lib Dems ""pathetic,"" saying more school places were being created overall. Asked about the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, David Cameron said free schools were ""an excellent innovation"" and he would ""get on with delivering what matters, which is good schools for our children."" The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Malcolm Bruce, said the budget for free schools was ""completely out of control"" and accused the education secretary of being ""monetarily obsessed."" He told the BBC: ""He [Mr Gove] is basically raiding money that should be going to the vast majority of schools that have real needs for a small number of free schools, many of which are in places where there isn't a pressure or a need."" Mr Bruce added: ""Michael Gove needs to be reined back, the programme needs to be properly costed and controlled."" The row is not the first within the coalition government over education policy. But BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the ""striking"" language used was evidence that both parts of the coalition were becoming more willing to air their disagreements and grievances in public a year ahead of the general election and less than two weeks before local and European elections. According to sources in Mr Clegg's office, last December Mr Gove overruled the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws to take PS400m from the Basic Need Budget for 2015-17. They claim the money was diverted to help cover a projected PS800m overspend between 2013 and 2016 in the budget of free schools - a project close to Mr Gove's heart. By Alex ForsythBBC Political Correspondent With less than two weeks to go before the local and European elections, increasing tensions between political parties are no surprise. The coalition parties in particular are trying to put clear water between them, and this isn't their first public disagreement. But on this occasion both sides have bandied round strong language - calling the other'pathetic' or'laughable' and describing funding decisions as'lunacy'. Those involved may see it as an opportunity to promote their party's policy and convince voters of what they stand for - in the strongest possible terms. To others it might be viewed as two political parties, both in government, attacking each other and policies they've officially both agreed. They may view this as good tactics. The public may view it differently. Free schools can be set up by parents, teachers, charities, businesses, universities, trusts, religious or voluntary groups, but are funded directly by central government. There are currently 174 free schools in England with another 116 approved to open from this September. A Lib Dem source said the Conservatives were ""putting the needs of a handful of their pet projects ahead of the requirements of the other 24,000 schools in the country."" ""Michael Gove was warned by the schools minister David Laws that this was a bad idea but the zealot pressed on anyway,"" said the source. Mr Gove's allies say the Basic Need Budget will still rise by more than PS200m a year in 2015-17 and argue that expansion of free schools will lead to more school places overall. Research last month highlighted by the Labour Party suggested the government was currently funding free schools for 1,500 more pupils than were actually attending. A spokesman for Mr Gove disputed the claim by critics of free schools that the places being created were not necessarily where they were most needed. He said: ""The suggestion we are cutting money for new places in areas of need to pay for free schools where they are not needed is totally wrong. ""These claims pretend that money spent in free schools is not creating new places in areas of need. That is simply not true."" Research by the Times Educational Supplement suggests that: The row comes days after emails leaked to the BBC indicated senior Department for Education officials had raised concerns school places may have to be cut if the Lib Dems' free school meals policy for infant children was implemented. A Conservative source at the Department for Education said: ""This is a pathetic attempt by the Lib Dems to divert attention from their botched school food policy which councils are being forced to fund by cutting money for school places. ""They opted for free schools and backed them from the start. For the Lib Dems to attack them now is frankly risible."" Labour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said free schools ""had the Lib Dem stamp of approval from day one. ""They're as much to blame for the failings as the Tories."" Mr Hunt said there was a ""national crisis"" over primary school places and said the secretary of state was behaving irresponsibly. The Lib Dems and Tories have also previously clashed over the employment of classroom staff without formal teaching qualifications and Mr Gove's decision not to re-appoint Labour peer Sally Morgan to watchdog Ofsted. Two days ago, a report by a cross-party group of MPs said financial management of some free schools was inadequate. The Public Accounts Committee said procedures were ""overly reliant"" on whistleblowers to uncover financial problems. The government said many of the committee's concerns were ""misplaced.""",1,xsum_human

"She sat on that leather chair. Smiling and without a care. She was living worry free. Her face, round, young and healthy. I remembered the times we had. As she lay in my arms after giving birth to our son. The last time we spoke about her illness. It's tough when you know someone is sick but can't do anything for them; especially your mother who has been there for everything at some point or another since before I could walk. There were many moments like that. In those days it seemed so scary that there wasn't much we could do. Just sit back and wait until they arrived home from work with whatever treatment plan the doctors gave them. Sometimes, just staying positive couldn't be enough. She would get tired of being weak, take off all the drugs and feel great one moment only to find herself laid out on the kitchen floor again as soon as she stepped into the house. All the while praying for answers, peace, something more than what she already knew. That something more did show up though. The answer and peace were always around us...in the form of prayers said by friends, family members, complete strangers and even the most mundane everyday tasks performed by people who have no idea how others are thinking. The reminder was usually given through an act of service whether it be cleaning the bathroom floors, walking next door to collect some mail or picking up dog poop. Wherever the need may be, these people simply showed up! They came together, cared and helped each other. And then God began His healing process. One day there was a knock on the front door. A friend of mine was visiting Charles's parents. He brought along his two young sons whom he kindly asked me watch over. When he left to go get dinner, I promptly went upstairs. To put on makeup (what else), grab a snack and turn on the news. Only to see a woman standing outside. Two little boys ran toward the car. She opened the hood and jumped right inside. Immediately the smile broke across my face. My children were going to meet their new big sister! Finally, after 6 years of waiting, she was coming! So the kids filled the car with laughter and excitement. We got ready and headed down the driveway. By this time we had a few extra hands to help gather things and prepare her room. Then we waited....and waited.....And waited!! That night finally came. After getting everyone tucked away and cleaned up, Francis slept peacefully and well in the hospital bed. At 8 o'clock my nieces and nephews arrived in the hospital. Her eldest daughter, Julie, came over to say goodnight. She stayed there till morning. I remember sitting beside her holding her hand saying ""I love you"" over and over again fearing the worst for her. 14 hours later, my niece called asking if I wanted to come visit Francis. No question here...of course!!! So I hurriedly packed up the kids and drove straight to the hospital. This scene played itself out over and over throughout this week. People showing up...helping where needed...praying for her health and strength daily. As we were trying to clean up her room, one of the nurses told me how the women of her ward loved to pray. Every evening they stood outside her window, holding rosaries and singing hymns in unison. Alongside her hospital bed were several small wooden stands where patients placed flowers in hopes that God will heal their pain. Prayer continued around us 247. With every single step I took, my heart felt full. God was showing Himself mighty. Turning a simple request for prayer into something larger. Something greater than any of us could imagine.",0,wp_machine_continuation_opt_6.7b

"Ed Miliband Steps Down as Leader of the Labour Party Following the Labour Party's disappointing results in the recent general election, party leader Ed Miliband has announced his resignation. Miliband, who has served as leader since 2010, acknowledged that the party had suffered a ""very difficult and disappointing night."" In a statement released on Friday morning, Miliband said that the election results were ""deeply disappointing"" and that he took ""absolute and total responsibility"" for the outcome. He added that the party needed to take a ""long, hard look"" at itself and the reasons for the defeat. Miliband's resignation comes after a night of surprising results, with the Conservatives winning an overall majority of seats in parliament. Labour, on the other hand, lost key seats in Scotland and saw their vote share decline across the country. Despite Miliband's sincere and passionate campaign, it has been criticized for lacking a clear direction and failing to appeal to voters beyond the party's traditional base. This has led to questions about the future direction of the Labour Party and who will take over as leader. According to party rules, a leadership contest will now take place, with potential candidates expected to announce their candidacy in the coming weeks. Possible contenders include former shadow cabinet members such as Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper, as well as Chuka Umunna, the current shadow business secretary. The Labour Party faces significant challenges in the wake of the general election defeat, including the need to reconnect with voters and rebuild its support base. Ed Miliband's resignation provides an opportunity for the party to reflect on its strategies and consider how best to move forward.",0,xsum_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats. They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution. The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem. It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past. It says: ""We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere. ""Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation."" It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves. Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms. IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN's) World Commission on Protected Areas. The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea. It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm. It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency. The IUCN's Prof Dan Laffoley said: ""What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses. ""The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm - but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."" The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: ""It's important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."" He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today. He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not. He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said. He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting. ""On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It's clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what's going on in the oceans,"" he said. Follow Roger on Twitter",1,xsum_human

"I've heard that when you scratch the part that itches, it makes them think on some level that they're scratching it themselves, and that's why their leg makes a scratching noise. Is this true? I can understand how it would work for dogs though... Quoting: Anonymous Coward 59759500 Yes, ""self-punishment"" is very common among animals (especially domesticated ones). It doesn't mean anything bad or traumatic has happened to them in life, just as we don't call an animal being scratched by another'self-inflicted'. We do have something similar with babies rolling around; children are known to be more prone to self injury than adults because of what psychologists term ""forgotten pain."" If your child goes through painful experiences while young, there might be lingering feelings of distress even after the experience was over. It takes time for these states of mind to dissipate completely. Having said all this, not everyone who injures himselfherself does so out of discomfort, but in order to get attention from others! The padlock theory sounds silly, especially since they could simply use another lock or pick one off if the good old keyhole wasn't available. But then it gets back to the question of what kind of locksmithing skills were possessed at the time of creation. There are other theories like ""kick-and-break,"" which claim that God created our bodies and left us locked up until someone breaks the door down by kicking it. This seems unlikely to me, since god wouldn't need doors. Quoting: mranubis There never existed any keys, so eventually, the only thing left to choose between was holding up tight against the wall until our skin peels away, or breaking free into the fresh air. Logic suggests that either way, having fingers will help tremendously. There was no such thing as an artificial limb before the invention of glass. Each individual had his own body including hands and feet, yet whenever he needed help moving about, he used those same natural limbs and a stick for support instead of lying helplessly on his bed with broken arms and legs. No matter how strong your faith may be, it did nothing to stop him getting stuck under furniture trying to move it, or unable to climb stairs due to heavy lifting etc., because he couldn't put forces together. He relied upon muscles alone, with bones playing second fiddle. Think about this, try walking without using your legs first - impossible - try climbing steps without using your knees too - nearly impossible - see where I'm going here? Whatever tools man made should always act according to its function, making things stronger rather than weaker, improving lives, giving mankind better access to food and clothing, medicine and shelter.

The best tip I'll give anybody living today is to improve their condition wherever possible, to increase what resources remain for future generations! At some point stones became fitted into sockets and wood was carved into shapely designs. Maybe nails came later, although most hand tools looked roughly the same throughout history. Wooden tablets with writing appeared towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC and fossils indicate that people have been building stone structures for much longer. For example, the oldest dated tower remains found to date, located near Sumer City, Iraq, dates back 9300 years. Many historians suggest that ancient Egyptians built pyramids during the 3rd millenium BC (around 2950BC) - long before anyone suspected using modern technology for construction purposes. And if dinosaurs walked Europe, they certainly didn't wear shoes or throw knives. When the Romans invaded Britain, slaves dug huge trenches across sand and clay using picks and shovels. In many cases, this involved pouring in water deep enough to float a Roman ship and allow it to dig itself a channel deeper still. These channels stretched miles inland and resembled giant drainage systems. A number of archaeological sites now exist which show evidence of great engineering efforts dating back thousands of years. Most famously preserved is Hadrian's Wall, constructed between AD122 - 136 and running 110km along the northern border of England and Scotland and stretching two thirds of the length of Great Britain. Such feats required massive labour and skill. Radiocarbon tests carried out on charcoal dated back from 8th century AD buried amongst the site in York Minster have shown that peat bogs were once landfills covering large areas of Yorkshire and Humber. During wet periods, rainwater seeped underground and formed layers of mud, silt and plant debris, which slowly compressed and solidified creating compact masses called 'peat'. Once dry, this hardy material lasted tens of thousands of years providing excellent preservation potential. Evidence shows that the practice of burial continued well into medieval times and archaeologists continue to uncover new finds.",0,eli5_machine_continuation_gpt_j
"""In full co-ordination with the government of Iraq, we're deploying a specialised expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces,"" Mr Carter said. The operators would carry out raids, free hostages and capture IS leaders. They would also conduct ""unilateral operations"" in Syria, he said. Islamic State conquered large swathes of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014. A US-led coalition of 65 countries is conducting a campaign against the militants in both countries. Mr Carter made the announcement in remarks to the House Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday. He did not offer specifics on troop numbers, but said they would also be focused on securing Iraq's borders and building the capacity of the Iraqi government forces. US special forces have already conducted operations in both Syria and Iraq - notably the killing of the IS oil chief Abu Sayaff in eastern Syria and the freeing of prisoners from the IS-held town of Hawija near Kirkuk in Iraq. But this is a clear indication from the Pentagon that their role will become more significant. The ""specialised expeditionary targeting force,"" as the Iraq group is being called, will not only assist local forces but will also conduct further ""unilateral"" raids into Syria. While this does not amount to significant numbers of boots on the ground, it is an escalation of America's role in direct combat. Mr Carter said there was now an important opportunity to divide IS militants in Iraq from those in Syria. In October, the US announced it would send up to 50 special forces soldiers to northern Syria as military advisers to Kurdish and rebel forces.",1,xsum_human

The second finding revealed that D. bruxellensis reacts in a distinct manner compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae when there is an excess amount of sugar. This difference may clarify why D. bruxellensis prefers oxidative metabolism or respiration instead of reductive metabolism or fermentation even when the supply of oxygen is limited.

"Between 2012 and 2015, cases of syphilis increased by 76, from 3,001 to 5,288, while gonorrhoea infections rose by 53, from 26,880 to 41,193, Public Health England data reveals. The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434,456. But experts say this could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed STI, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13 of young men and 32 of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7 drop - was seen in young women, and experts say this was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The FPA charity's chief executive, Natika Halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering. Genevieve Edwards, of Marie Stopes UK, said the statistics should ""set alarm bells ringing"" about the availability of sexual health services for young people and men who have sex with men. ""We have to keep a focus on preventing sexual ill health, and providing prompt diagnosis and treatment to those who need it,"" she added. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the continued rise of gonorrhoea was extremely disturbing, given the further spread of drug-resistant infections. Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, said: ""We need to do more to raise awareness about STIs and how they can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms.

"I remember a story I used to be told as a child. It was usually told to me by my father in the cold winter months when there was little else to do but tell tales by the hearth. We'd gather round and he'd go on to speak of the dark Mire Witches of the west. How he'd weave a fine and horrifying story of their black magic. How they'd eat goats and use bones to put hexes on whole towns. And most of all, he'd whisper, steal children. The story seems to have underplayed it a bit. ""Reynault,"" Hobbs called in a hushed voice, snapping me back to reality. ""Oh,"" I stammered, not realizing I'd been daydreaming, ""sorry."" ""Keep yer wits,"" He whispered, looking around slowly, ""one of these grimy bitches'll get you, otherwise. Keep yer eyes on the trees too. They look like the branches sometimes."" I nodded in response, raising my long sword a bit. I liked Hobbs. He wasn't the most personable of fellows, but he knew his trade and he cared about doing a thorough job. For what it's worth, if I had to choose only one person to do this with it'd be him. However, I would not want to choose only one person. But that was the situation at hand. A week ago the fort I was stationed at received a letter from a very, very small village. The letter stated that for a score of nights children had been going missing and that they believed something lived in the mire and was stealing the children in the night. This was not deeply uncommon, as it was usually just as like that the children would wander off and drown in mud as it was for some fae or devil to sneak in and snatch them from their cradle. But I am a knight, and in fact was the only proper knight at the fort, so it was considered my duty to handle such a matter. I assembled my entourage: Hobbs, my veteran man-at-arms, Silas, my strapping squire, and Alfie, my portly physician and apothecary. Once equipped we set off south and west for the village. After a few days time we arrived to the village finding half of them dead and the other half dying. They'd been plagued by a curse the likes I had not seen before. Hobbs knew what it was, having learned of spirits and darker magics than I in the stacks of Jerusalem. After Hobbs showed him how to make a poultice that would slow their ailment and ease their pain we left Alfie to tend to the villagers who still drew breath and Silas to guard him. Had any of those villagers been strong enough to stand without spitting bile or shitting their trousers I would've taken Silas as well. But none could and Alfie is a paunchy fellow and certainly could not hold off a crippled goat much less a mire witch, so Silas stayed. And now we crept, Hobbs and I, through the murk and shadow of the mire, looking for the child eaters. ""Hobbs."" I called out, quietly as I could. ""What?"" He responded, equally as quiet though slightly more irritated. ""What if there are no children left alive?"" He snorted and adjusted his padded coif, ""Of course none of them are alive. But we can still put the fuckin' baby eaters to the mud."" I felt a bit of will drain from me. I knew that none of them were alive since I got the letter, but most of the reason I took hunts like this was to help people. To save them. Preventing death was still preserving life, but it did not feel like saving it. Hobbs stopped, stood still, motioned that I do the same, and peered intently into the brush ahead. He pointed with his crossbow, ""Look at that. I think we're close."" I stared towards the weeds in question and saw what he was referring to. They were dead. Not only that but as I looked past them I saw that many plants were shriveled and dead. It reminded me very much of an ivy, constricting a small tree'til the life was squeezed out of it. I took a few steps forward, my mail shirt jingling softly in the silence of the dreary woods. When suddenly my sword was like ice. I gripped it tight in both hands, bringing it to the ready. It felt so very cold in my hands, the chill of it ran down my arms and through my chest. I spun about scanning my surroundings and Hobbs did the same. I saw frost running along the surface of the muddy water and over the now wilting foliage and trees. I didn't even notice the lack of insects'til now. The silence was suffocating. ""Fuckin' come out, you bitch."" Hobbs muttered through gritted teeth. I un-slung my shield and gripped it in my left hand. Hobbs and I were practically back to back now, rotating slowly, eyes never resting on one spot. But then I saw her, emerging slowly from the water. She did look like wood. She was nude, her skin rough, mottled, and leathery. All that I could make out of her face was a pair of yellow eyes peering out from a mess of grey-green mattes and grime that was her hair. And out of the hair poked a pair of antlers atop the crown of her head. The moment she'd risen from the water she glided across it at me. I cried out, ran forward, and swung at her with my blade, arms stiff with chill and fear. She slid out of the way, dodging my attack like I meant to swingat the air instead of her. Hobbs had pivoted and leveled his crossbow at her, leading and firing where she was about to be. The bolt struck, grazing her along the ribs. She screamed and waved a hand at him. He, in turn, screamed as well and I saw ribbons of blood fly from his face. I made up the distance between myself and the witch and tried to catch her under the chin with the point of my sword, but she turned and struck my blade aside with a gnarled, clawed hand. She spat at me and I raised my shield to block it. The spit ate through the leather and wood of my chevron like it was nothing'til I sizzling against my gloved hand. I staggered back, tossing my now useless shield to the ground and tugging the glove off after it. Hobbs had regained himself and had knocked another bolt which he now put into her right thigh. She screamed again and sped towards him, black blood stream from her wounds. I made chase and he pulled a hatchet from his belt to defend himself. She clawed at him, wailing all the while and he parried he blows best he could. A few slipped by his guard, catching him along the forearms and chest leaving long red wrents. No focus on me though. I put the tip of my blade up and through the center of her back between her shoulder blades. It came out of her chest just above Hobbs' face. I twisted my blade and with a great heave lifted her from the ground as she flailed to get free. Hobbs then hacked at her limbs with the hatchet, freeing each hand and leg from their respective trunk. Eventually she stopped flailing. I removed her ragged head from her shoulders and we burnt the rest in a relatively dry part of the mire. We searched for a few more hours for the hole she'd crawled out of, but found little save for some bones. When we left the village all who still lived were cured and healthy, though hollow to be true. I stung and throbbed all the way back to the fort. But most of all I felt the chill I'd felt when first she'd crept upon us. I do not believe that any hearth I'd ever feel would save me from the chill.",1,wp_human
"Everton Boss Roberto Martinez Hits Back at Critics Over Tactics Everton manager, Roberto Martinez, has hit out at critics suggesting that he is tactically stubborn. The Spaniard has faced criticism for persisting with the same style of play, moving the ball on the ground out from defence. Martinez insists that he is 'innovative' in his tactics and points to the adjustments he made during Everton's win over Southampton on Saturday. In that game, the Toffee's coach shifted from his preferred 4-2-3-1 to an unorthodox 3-4-3 formation, showcasing his ability to adapt and change his tactics when necessary. ""I know that it has been said that I am stubborn with my tactics, but I think that we have shown we can be innovative and adaptable when necessary,"" Martinez said. ""Against Southampton, we made a few changes and got the result that we wanted."" Everton's 3-0 win over Southampton was a much-needed boost after a disappointing end to last season, and Martinez believes that the team is heading in the right direction. ""I believe that we have a strong team and that we will continue to get better as the season progresses,"" Martinez continued. ""We have a great blend of experienced players and young talent, and I am confident that we can achieve our goals this season."" Further defending his tactics, Martinez added that his possession-based style has been successful in the past, particularly during his time at Swansea City and Wigan Athletic. ""I've always believed in playing a brand of football that focuses on moving the ball out from the defensive areas and retaining possession,"" he said. ""It's worked well for my teams in the past and I believe that it can work for Everton, too."" The Everton boss has also received support from his players, with midfielder Gareth Barry commenting that the team is fully behind their manager's tactics. ""We all have belief in the style of play and the tactics that the manager wants us to employ,"" Barry said. ""We know that if we stick to the game plan and execute it properly, we can get the results that we desire."" Ultimately, Martinez is adamant that his tactical approach can bring success to Everton this season. As the team continues to adapt and improve, he will be hoping that the results will silence his critics once and for all.",0,cnn_gpt4
"First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and as an adult male, I am happy that I was circumcised. I believe that a circumcision is a personal choice of the parent, and should not be a governmental issue. I do not think that circumcision should be mandatory, as I believe in the freedom of choice. I don't think circumcision should be banned because some people are religiously opposed to circumcision. If people want to practice male circumcision, they should be free to do so. It is a personal choice. But there is a disturbing trend that I have been seeing in the news lately, and that is the practice of circumcision in girls. I understand that there is a religious aspect to this, but I think it should be illegal. The practice of circumcision in females is a disgusting practice. It is not just a removal of foreskin, as is the case in males, but a removal of the clitoris. It is a practice designed to remove the possibility of sexual pleasure in females. It is also a very painful procedure, and has not been proven to be necessary for the health of females. I feel that all governments should do whatever they can to stop this practice. It should be outlawed. It is a disgusting procedure that needs to be stopped. I agree with you completely. It is a barbaric procedure that needs to be stopped. I am also in agreement with your other post about letting kids be kids. The world can be a dangerous place, but I think we need to let kids have their freedom and autonomy.

The Chinese tech giant had been shipping the software, called Superfish, on its products since September 2014. It was designed to show ""contextually relevant"" advertisements on websites visited by the user. However, security experts have since discovered that the program was vulnerable to attack and posed a potential security risk for customers. Lenovo has now issued an apology to its customers, saying: ""We apologize profusely for causing these concerns. We acted swiftly and decisively once these concerns began to be raised."" The company has released a tool to completely remove the software from affected computers, however it has come under fire from some who believe it should have been more open about the presence of the adware in the first place. The incident is a reminder of how important it is for companies to ensure their products are secure and trustworthy. It also highlights the need for transparency when it comes to what is being shipped with new devices. Lenovo has vowed to take steps to avoid similar problems in future, including introducing a clear policy on pre-installed software and regularly testing products for vulnerabilities.

I think that as long as transgendered persons that are pre-operation are attracted to the same sex as themselves (ex: a pre-op male attracted to men), then they should be considered gay. I see them as identifying with that gender. Post-op they identify with the other gender and are attracted to the opposite gender than themselves (ex: a now female attracted to men). My friend disagreed and stated that they are ""one gender in another gender's body"" (ex: a female in a male's body) and would not identify as 'gay'. I feel that even though they may psychologically identify with the other gender, the fact is they are still physically their own gender. For example, a male psychologically identifying as a female pre-op is still a male which makes a male attracted to a male and therefore gay. I don't see the psychological aspect of the person as making a difference to their attraction; if you are attracted to the same gender as yourself, you are gay. CMV",1,cmv_human

Robert 'Bob' Burns Jr, who was a founding member of the Southern hard rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd and their previous drummer, passed away on Friday night in a car accident located near Cartersville, Georgia. According to Tracey Watson, a spokeswoman for the Georgia State Patrol, Burns' car veered off the road and hit a mailbox and a tree while approaching a curve shortly before midnight. Robert 'Bob' Burns Jr, who was a former drummer of the Southern hard rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, passed away on Friday evening. As it neared a curve in Cartersville, Georgia, Burns' car veered off the road just prior to midnight. The band in Jacksonville, Florida, was founded by five individuals, including Burns, who also played on the first two albums. The wreck resulted in the death of Burns, aged 64. The seatbelt was not being worn by him. When Allman was just 24 years old, he crashed his motorcycle into a truck outside of Macon, Georgia, which is around a two-hour drive from Cartersville. Following the sudden passing of Allman. The song Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd was devoted to the memory of someone. The band, which was established in Jacksonville, Florida, had five musicians including Burns who played on their initial two albums.

Thus TRPM channels regulate the variability of the defecation oscillator in C. elegans. We conclude that the mean and the variability of the defecation oscillator are separable. Our results support the notion that there is a strong underlying pacemaker which is able to function independently of the observable defecation rhythm and is not perturbed by increases in the variability of the cycle. The interaction of gon-2 and gtl-1 with other components of the oscillator shows that TRPM channels play an important role in the oscillator machinery. Such a role may be through either regulation of cation levels or membrane properties or both. Specifically our results support previous proposals that gon-2 and gtl-1 regulate IP3 signalling and that kqt-3 may act by altering calcium influx. Our results provide novel insights into the properties of the defecation oscillator and thus to our understanding of ultradian rhythms.,1,pubmed_human

"The Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military code, called the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race as certain other empires had during their times. It is said that within this empire at one time or another there were over 20 different ethnic groups in addition to Mongols, which represented the diversity of those peoples who lived under its rule.[1] Contents Understandings about foreign tribes are rare among people living in Mongolia but it has been argued that it would have existed if relations with neighbouring nations were good.[23] When they first came into contact with Europe, the Mongols thought Europeans looked like them because they resembled Mongolians physically,[4] considered themselves members of the same great family[5] and also believed they originated from China.[6] At some point, when asked whether he was a European or Chinese, Genghis responded ""I am neither.7] There was no clear border between Mongolia and Russia until the later 18th century, so for centuries both countries shared boundaries with each other. Nevertheless, even then, Russians considered Central Asia part of their country. This fact was confirmed some years after the fall of the medieval world when Russian chroniclers mentioned that Muslim merchants traded across these areas along with Mongols as early as .[8] Some historians say it started earlier, around 1159 CE.[9] There was never any formal treaty either written nor oral regarding borders between the Mongolian and Russian Empires. Nonetheless, there was an agreement based on mutual trust dating back to Genghis' reign where Mongol-Russian relations kept improving throughout history before reaching their peak during his era while still remaining friendly enough to cause him stress.[10] During the late 13th century, representatives from both empires met regularly in order to discuss diplomatic matters. These meetings continued up until the 16th century, however, due to pressure placed upon the Mongols by foreigners (who invaded southern Russia), negotiations ceased. In 1547, two delegations representing Russia and the Golden Horde put down roots in Moscow and St Petersburg respectively. That marked the beginning of a period known as Muscovite supremacy when Muscovites built the largest town north of Siberia and founded the capital city Saint Petersburg. By 1500, Moscow had surpassed many cities in size and wealth all over the Eastern hemisphere. So Moscow became more powerful than Constantinople, Rome, London or Paris. Despite this growth, Moscow's influence remained nominal, and the Russian government felt itself increasingly encircled by Mongol power, especially since the rise of rival Kazan.[11] However, between 1480 and 1600, despite certain setbacks such as the Crimean Tatars attacking Moscow for the third time in less than fifty years, Moscow managed to make gains against the Golden Horde. Another factor contributing to this trend towards Moscow's dominance was Prince Vasily III Romanovich (1503 - 22 October 1533) being born and raised in Moscow rather than Vladimir. He took the title Grand Prince of Tver in 1509 and Tsar Ivan IV Ippolitovich ascended to throne in 1530.[12] Russia's geographical location on the Eurasian continent made it strategically important for ruling powers. Russia maintained relatively stable political stability compared to neighbors. For most of the Middle Ages, Moscow was safe against invasions and attacks except those initiated by the expansionist Golden Horde. Therefore, Moscow's rulers decided whenever possible to maintain peace with neighboring states, including those in the West. As a result, these Western regions grew wealthier and richer over the course of several hundred years. Trade thrived, artists flourished, cultures began developing and scientific discoveries occurred. By the end of the 16th century, Moscow gained control over much of what is now Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, parts of Germany and Scandinavia through wars waged primarily by Ivan the Terrible. After gaining independence from Moscow in 1708, Polish territories were later annexed again in 1772. The Russian state expanded further eastward in the 19th century and eventually reached Manchuria in easternmost East Asia via the Treaty of Nerchinsk signed in 1689.

"People can control their own thoughts and thoughts are what dictates emotion. I always hear people say how you don't choose your feelings but I believe if you try hard enough you can. People think if they're offended by something it is some kind of right. I think that is people just choosing to get unnecessarily upset. Edit: First of all I thought I should point out I'm a girl. Secondly not talking about traumatic events and I think it's important to be upset when your grandmother dies or whatever. I mean everyday situations for 'everyday' people. I'm saying this purely through experience and not scientific research so would be interested in any science which proves me wrong. From my experience, controlling emotions is not an easy thing and sometimes I find myself thinking things which I find upsetting and I have to check myself. I have a father who is never sad or angry and this IS through choice, he has worked hard to become like this (and apparently wasn't always like this). People assume he has repressed emotions because they can't believe that he chooses to be this way because like some have said ""why would you choose to be upset"" and to that I say you don't consciously decide to be upset it just happens through thinking about sad things. Remove those thoughts and you remove those feelings. I also think that things can be offensive but you don't have to be offended. For example, if someone told me I was an ugly bitch that would be an offensive statement but I could choose not to take offense. People think that if they are offended by someone they have been wronged. To me taking offensive to something is to make it personal to you. Hope this clears up some of the questions.",1,cmv_human

"Dear Mom: Today I think I saw the worst of humanity. Today may have been the day of the armistice, but I feel that there can never be peace, not in my lifetime. Today, the Germans pulled out of the area. They left the town to its people, including the tiniest baby to the oldest man. Then, they went into the woods, to the homes of the peasants. They broke in, smashing the door in the faces of the families, who were forced to line up against the wall. They broke everything they could, smashed furniture, clothes, everything they could lay their hands on. Then, they tore the linens off the beds. They took the mattresses, and all the pillows. They threw the children out of their beds, and hit the mothers. They took everything, and even the cows and the horses. Then, they took the men, they tied them up, and forced them to walk 10 kilometers to the next town. I saw the Germans, in their retreat, forcing peasants to walk, in the cold, on the snow. And they left in the wake of their retreat a trail of death and destruction. I saw old people, and children, all standing in the snow, all exposed to the wind, and the cold. I saw men hit by the Germans with the butts of their rifles. I saw all of this, and I cried. And I cried, because the Germans were taking the peasants away to be forced labor, to be forced to work for them. And I cried, because I knew that there can never be peace. Not with the Germans. They are a cancer on the face of the earth, and I hope that they are annihilated, for if they are not, they will ruin this world. I cried because I knew there will never be peace. And I cried because I knew that the war is far from being over. Dear Mom: It is getting colder here, and it is snowing again. I am working hard, so that I can get home as soon as possible. I have a lot of work. We are constantly moving, and it's very exhausting. The Germans are retreating, and we are pursuing them. It is not as easy as it sounds. First of all, we are not all that far away from them, so we have to take care not to get too close, so as not to be caught. And second, they are constantly reorganizing their front. We have to constantly move, and take up new positions, and build new defenses. And we are constantly busy. We have to dig trenches, and build bunkers, and install communications equipment. It never ends, and it is tiring. We work all day, and then at night, we work some more. And during the day, we have to sleep, and eat, and keep ourselves clean.

"Based on the ability of an amino-terminal fragment of the beta1 subunit to inhibit activity of an heterodimer consisting only of the catalytic domains (alphacatbetacat), Winger and Marletta (Biochemistry 2005, 44:4083-90) have proposed a direct interaction of the amino-terminal region of beta1 with the catalytic domains. In support of such a concept of ""trans"" regulation of sGC activity by the H-NOX domains our results indicate that the domains within sGC are organized in a way that allows for direct interaction of the amino-terminal regulatory domains with the carboxy-terminal catalytic region. In addition, we constructed ""fluorescent-conjoined"" sGC's by fusion of the alpha amino-terminus to the beta1 carboxy-terminus leading to a monomeric, fluorescent and functional enzyme complex.

"The clinic was a dreary place filled with the palpable atmosphere of mounting dread. It was probably some converted abortion clinic - never intended, really, to be cheerful. Whatever it may have been originally, that will not matter any more. I sat in my chair facing the glass doors at the end of the waiting room, which looked into the kitchen and dining area of the abortion facility. The chairs were all arranged around the wall like the spokes on an imaginary wheel. I had just come from another appointment where four women huddled together against one wall; behind them lay their belongings piled up along the floor. They waited for me as if they expected every minute of the next hour would bring a doctor's call. My heart sank when I saw them - such little children - barely able to stand without help or rest for even short periods, but still bearing the weight of life within their tiny frames. Their heavy bags hung over their shoulders. One woman could scarcely walk because her body ached so badly she could hardly lift herself away from the ground. All of us felt dirty somehow after those hours spent there huddling alone between walls made of metal. But no one ever spoke about how we were feeling except to complain, often loudly enough for everyone else to hear: How long is this going to go on? Why aren't you getting rid of himher yet?

"Although the SFU grading system is considered the predominant grading system for HN, its application in clinical practice has been inconsistent. While this may be due to the grading system itself, it is possible that deficient training and confidence are the root causes. Our data supports this by demonstrating that most clinicians receive only casual training and accordingly, report low confidence in their knowledge and ability to grade HN. Therefore, we conclude that there exists a strong need to improve the teaching of the SFU grading system. e-Learning has been shown to be effective in teaching difficult topics and skills. We demonstrate that e-Learning with CEVL is effective in increasing both the confidence and accuracy of SFU grading of pediatric HN. Limitations of our study include a small sample size, low response rate, and discrepant participation.

Maximum theoretical efficiency (assuming friction free engine with no entropy loss) is equal to 1 - T (air) T (engine) where the temperatures are expressed in absolute unit (such as Kelvins). Basically, the colder the outside air, the more work can be put into it (generally via compressing it even further in the piston cylinder) to bring it to the engine's operating temperature.,A ""cold air intake"" is often a hot air intake that ironically removes the factory cold air intake most of the time. People love them cause they make the car louder, even though they sometimes make the car slower than stock. You will notice your car is ""faster"" on the butt dyno, but that's because you took a smooth and linier power curve and made it peaky. Save your money for basic maintenance and factory replacement parts.','A colder airfuel mixture will also be more knock resistant, which means that a more advanced spark timing can be used. More ignition advance means more power, if the engine is knock limited.', ""Cold air is dense compared to hot air, which allows for a better quality burn when it is mixed with fuel and ignited. However, adding a cold air intake doesn't always add power, cars are tuned from factory to perform well under all conditions, a happy medium between economy and power. They achieve this using multiple sensors that take various readings so the fuel air mixture can be adjusted to suit the climate driving conditions. Once you remove the factory intake and replace it with a higher flowing cold air intake, you upset the happy medium and can actually cause the engine to run too rich or too lean as the car wasn't tuned to run with these parts. Of course you can get the control unit recalibrated to suit which overcomes the problem.,"" ""Same thing for airplane engines. Colder air is more dense so more fuel can be delivered for combustion. You can't just throw more fuel as combustion will not increase unless there is a matching amount of oxygen. Not to mention the aerodynamics of the airplane is also improved with the denser air.,Cold air is denser, and thus contains more oxygen per volume, allowing more fuel to be used to produce more power. Also, cold air is further in temperature from the temperature of the exhaust gases, and thus expands more during combustion than warmer air would, producing more power as a result.",1,eli5_human

"Terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil was achieved through a combination of techniques including the addition of biochar, charcoal, bone fragments, and other organic material to the soil. This was accompanied by the creation of raised beds that allowed for better drainage, aeration, and moisture retention. The origins of this soil go back thousands of years to when the indigenous people of the Amazon region began to cultivate crops. They discovered that the use of these techniques led to higher crop yields and healthier soil. Over time, the accumulated organic material and charcoal produced a soil that was rich in nutrients, with the ability to retain moisture and resist erosion. Today, terra preta is gaining recognition as an important model for sustainable agriculture. The methods used to create this soil can improve soil fertility, reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers, and help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil. This provides a sustainable solution for both agriculture and climate change mitigation.",0,squad_machine_continuation_gpt-3.5-trubo

"I don't know when it happened. The virus was so infectious that you could come into contact with contaminants hundreds of times a day. Air, water, food, nothing was safe. We started as seven living in sterile isolation. The last of them had turned 43 days ago, and without anyone else I was struggling. Every clean-up was followed by the same meticulous procedure: suit up, flesh disposal, bleaching. We all had a role, so every time someone turned it got tougher for those left behind. When we were tired we made mistakes. Recent losses had led to 20-hour stretches inside the suits. A rip in the suit for 3 minutes was enough.

She sat in the safe room for days, spending more and more time glazed, slack and unmoving. I didn't dare go in to comfort her; we both knew what was happening. After the final clean-up the days stretched out endlessly. No hope of rescue, counting down the days until the end. 30 years of recycled air, bleach, isolation.

""I thought you said you didn't want our secrets."" ""Shut up. Or you can go find someone else to do the job."" - The nine-lived panther was a living legend. True, his blade was not the quickest. And his fist was not the toughest. Nor was his lineage of any particular importance. But he was incredibly, incredibly fortunate in battle. As far as the Nameless Ones could remember, the Nine-Lived Panther had never received anything more serious than scratches and bruises. Even the All-Knowing Scholar, Wu Ji, was at a loss to explain his victory streak. Of course, the fact that Wu Ji's head had been loped off five months ago probably helped a bit. And tonight, the Laughing Shadow was going to find out. The secret to the Nine-Lived Panther's success. Not that she'd actually fight, of course. With a grin, she barely suppressed her trademark, manic giggle. This was going to be good. Earlier that day, the Golden Spear had received a rather interesting letter. A letter addressed to him by the Nine-Lived Panther. A letter detailing exactly how upset the Panther was with his rising fame. And it ended with a demand. Meet up at the Silvertree Grove at midnight, or the Panther would go to his home - and the Panther knew he kept an old ma and a hot-blooded younger brother at home. Interestingly, the Panther had also received a letter. One that was written by the Golden Spear. A greatly edited letter on the essence of chivalry, and how the Underworld was to be rid of a fame-hogging demon. It ended with a challenge - meet up at the Silvertree Grove at midnight. And now, the combatants emerged. - The trees were not silver. They were merely normal trees. But on the night of a full moon, when the light was just right and the night was perfectly clear - For a brief, wondrous moment, the entire grove would appear to be bathed in silver. At least, so claimed the drunk poet that named the grove. If he had been here on this night - a night of drifting clouds, the crescent moon grinning manically at the fighters below, he might have named it the Arena Grove instead. Or something. Goodness knew where those drunk poets got their ideas from. The Nine-Lived Panther stumbled, cursing, as he finally made it into the clearing. By the Immortals. He was drunk. He was so very, very, drunk. He was so drunk that he couldn't have walked here. But he did. You've got to admire that sort of dedication. The Golden Spear disagreed. He never drank. Never celebrated. His life had been dedicated to honour, glory, and his golden spear. To challenge him - then show up drunk - was the height of all disrespect and probably stood against everything he stood for. The wind laughed in the branches. The golden spear was lowered. A flash of lightning; a bolt of the Heavens in the hands of man, a golden spear that zigged and zagged on an erratic, unpredictable path. An erratic, unpredictable path that could only end in one way: The end of the Nine-Lived Panther. Then a cry of shock. The lightning disappeared. A completely normal spear - two hands still attached to it - rolled in the grass. A head - eyes wide-open in disbelief - soon followed. The Panther's eyes were stone-cold sober. Without even sparing the corpse a second glance, he left. It was such a shame. Had he stayed for just a moment longer, he might have heard the faintest hints of a giggle make its way out deep within the shadows. - She should have guessed. It was impossible for luck to carry anyone this far. His poor swordsmanship was faked. His seemingly reckless acts were calculated. All in a vain attempt to confuse those stronger than he was. And, for the longest period of time, it had worked. Amazing. For a moment, she almost felt guilty for ruining such a well-crafted plan. Almost. It was a shame. But such was the way of the Underworld. Even this plan - elaborate as it had been - was simple enough to foil with the meddling of a rich brat and a hot blooded youth. If it fell apart around him, then the Nine-Lived Panther only had himself to blame. Such is the Underworld. -",1,wp_human

"The lycan house and the Sanguine house has been at war for six months. Truth be told it was petty at first. Just a bunch of guys messing with another one's house, but then it escalated to life or death territory. What started as an argument between two wolves turned into a three-way fight and last night one of them finally bit off more than he could chew. It's hard not to laugh when I talk about Logan because I know how serious this is. ""You don't think it's funny?"" Tucker asks me again and shakes his head no. It takes him awhile before he speaks again from the doorway that leads outside onto the deck. ""So you haven't met Drew since the incident? He come by yet?"" I shrug my shoulders noncommittally. ""No. The only people who have seen me in weeks are either on shift or they're coming back soon. As far as anyone knows I'm still out there doing my thing while someone else does theirs over here."" Tucker whistles quietly once before continuing. ""And what kind of things would those things entail? Like is your arm healing all right?"" I nod my acknowledgment several times. ""My arm's fine."" Another mischievous grin crosses my face and I look down at the floor. ""But we can't get too excited around here so I won't say anything that might give away the secret."" That doesn't stop the smile from spreading across my lips though. ""Look...about Drew..."" He stares up at me intently. I blink at the seriousness of his expression, hoping it will subside quickly enough so I can continue speaking without being interrupted anymore. ""About Drew...well, let's just say he's probably going to end up getting hurt pretty bad if he keeps on with his stupid games. You should go tell him that. I mean - you know - if...if you want to."" His brow furrows slightly but he nods slowly, trying to understand exactly what I've said. When he looks back up he gives me another thoughtful stare and says nothing. His silence hangs heavy in the air until he turns around to walk towards the door. ""Don't worry about Logan. He'll live. Or rather, he'll heal eventually. And you're welcome to stay here whenever you like."" There's a weightiness to his words that makes me suddenly very uncomfortable. Something isn't quite right about them. I turn to ask questions later, after I make sure Logan survives whatever battle lies ahead. Don't push him; maybe it's easier thought out loud than actually talking about it now. Not much happens during our conversation but Logan starts sweating profusely within seconds and I start feeling queasy myself. Maybe it's just allergies or something stupid like that. But even still, I feel like I need some fresh air. Whatever secrets were revealed by my speaking aloud earlier seem to resolve themselves behind closed doors and I decide to take advantage of the opportunity. If I stayed here any longer I'd start acting weird around Logan and I don't really trust myself around him anyway. Every time I see him in person I feel the urge to touch him which is only made worse by the fact that he seems to be drawn toward me himself. If I didn't already know better, I'd swear he wanted to do more than just talk. He smiles a few times before disappearing into the backyard and the sound of boots hitting pavement follows shortly afterwards. Once I hear the front door close I follow suit and hurry back inside where I sink gratefully into the couch. I sigh heavily once I realize that putting on clothes and leaving feels like taking off a warm blanket. Even though no one came looking for me today, I'm reluctant to leave. I suppose everyone needs their own little sanctuary sometimes. Then again, since I was born into the EMT world, I guess I always knew I had somewhere safe - physically and emotionally - to go whenever I need it. My whole life I felt enveloped in danger and uncertainty until it became an integral part of life itself. Now that everything is changing, I wonder why it took me this long to figure that out.

"Gary Ballance hit a chanceless hundred for England on Thursday - his fourth century in nine Tests - that further closes the door on the banished Kevin Pietersen returning to the side whatever the ballyhoo. Ballance's 122 was the mainstay of England's 333 for seven declared leaving West Indies needing an unlikely 438 to win the first Test. They finished the fourth day on 98 for two after another superb Chris Jordan slip catch made the breakthrough. Gary Ballance scored 122 as England took firm control of the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua . Ballance plays a sweep shot during his impressive innings at theSir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Ballance, who had a poor World Cup , said: 'It's been a tough winter but four bad innings don't make you a bad cricketer. I would like to think I was settled at number three after last summer. Scoring a hundred in a Test match is a great feeling. You have to enjoy doing well,' as his joyous century celebration indicated. Even with the ever-present Pietersen factor Ballance added: 'That's international sport, I haven't doubted my place. I knew I had done well before. I didn't come here thinking that I was going to get dropped. I was focused on scoring runs and to get a hundred is huge.' There needs to be an opening for KP to make a sensational England comeback. But there looks to be no room in the line-up for Pietersen. Ballance at number three followed by Ian Bell and Joe Root seems a rock solid middle order for the Ashes this summer, by when KP will be 35.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image classification. Despite its high accuracies, CNN has been shown to be easily fooled by some adversarial examples, indicating that CNN is not robust enough for pattern classification. In this paper, we argue that the lack of robustness for CNN is caused by the softmax layer, which is a totally discriminative model and based on the assumption of closed world (i.e., with a fixed number of categories). To improve the robustness, we propose a novel learning framework called convolutional prototype learning (CPL). The advantage of using prototypes is that it can well handle the open world recognition problem and therefore improve the robustness. Under the framework of CPL, we design multiple classification criteria to train the network. Moreover, a prototype loss (PL) is proposed as a regularization to improve the intra-class compactness of the feature representation, which can be viewed as a generative model based on the Gaussian assumption of different classes. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that CPL can achieve comparable or even better results than traditional CNN, and from the robustness perspective, CPL shows great advantages for both the rejection and incremental category learning tasks.",1,sci_gen_human

"Scientists have successfully demonstrated a proof of concept that could lay the foundation for quantum batteries. In a recent study, researchers at the University of Cambridge in the UK have shown that they can use entanglement, one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, to create a battery that could store energy for a long time without leakage. The principle of entanglement refers to the phenomenon where two quantum particles become connected in such a way that their properties are no longer independent of each other - they become correlated. When two particles are entangled, any change that occurs to one particle will also affect the other, no matter how far away they are from each other. The researchers used this principle to develop a quantum battery that would be able to store energy indefinitely, without leaking or decaying. They did this by creating a system of entangled particles that were placed inside a supercooled, high vacuum environment. The team also found that the energy density of their quantum battery was much higher than any other battery that currently exists. In fact, they calculated that their system could hold over 1,000 times more energy than a conventional battery of the same size. While the study is still in its early stages, the researchers are optimistic that their work could pave the way for the development of quantum batteries that would be much more efficient and long-lasting than current battery technologies. Quantum batteries could revolutionize many industries, including electric cars and renewable energy storage. The ability to store large amounts of energy in a small space with no leakage or decay would be a game-changer for these industries. The team plans to continue their research and development of the technology, with the goal of creating a prototype quantum battery in the near future. If successful, this could be a major step forward in the ongoing efforts to create a sustainable and energy-efficient future.",0,tldr_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo

"Relatives of 24 rubber plantation workers killed by British troops almost 70 years ago in Malaya have been dealt a devastating blow after losing an appeal for an official investigation into the tragedy. The families had been pushing for an inquiry into the deaths of their loved ones, which occurred in 1948 during the Malayan Emergency, a conflict between British and Commonwealth forces and pro-independence fighters. However, the Malaysian Federal Court has rejected the relatives' calls for a review of the incident, ruling that the case was closed and that any further action would be pointless. The court's decision has been met with dismay by the families of those killed, who insist they are still seeking justice. ""We are deeply disappointed that the highest court in Malaysia has refused to investigate this tragic event,"" said one relative. ""Our loved ones deserve to have their memories honoured and their deaths properly investigated. It is our duty to ensure that these injustices are not forgotten."" The Malayan Emergency began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, with British and Commonwealth troops fighting against the Communist insurgency in the region. It is estimated that 11,000 lives were lost during the conflict. The incident involving the 24 rubber plantation workers remains one of the most controversial episodes of the war, with allegations of excessive force on both sides.

"Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, Poland and Lithuania by 31 December 1919 or be expelled.[1] The Red Army entered the city on 3 September 1920 with a large force of some 150,000 troops including 50 divisions for which they were given four days to prepare as part of a general plan for the liberation of Warsaw.[234] On 9 September 1920 Polish authorities issued an ultimatum asking German forces (notably occupying Lithuanian forces) to leave. With this demand ignored, the Soviets launched Operation Barbarossa at 8:30 am local time on 10 September, accompanied by artillery bombardments.[5] At noon the city was taken by surprise resulting in heavy casualties among both civilians and soldiers. A counterattack begun on 11 October 1920 failed - though not without controversy within Soviet ranks;[6] many Bolshevik military leaders felt that Germany had been defeated earlier than expected but Stalin had ordered his commanders ""to take revenge"" anyway because he believed it would discredit Hitler's reputation as a military leader. However, most Bolsheviks supported Gorbachev's decision against any further reprisals.[7] On 25 January 1936 Adolf Hitler visited the capital where he met with Joseph Stalin who offered him recognition if he departed Ukraine with all his guns and ammunition,[8] but Hitler refused and turned down the invitation again. He also rejected Lenin's offer in 1922 when it came up during his visit there.[9] It is often argued that Hitler only wanted control over parts of eastern Europe so that he could use them later to isolate Germany economically while leaving western European countries free to trade with each other post-war. It has even been suggested that Hitler wished to regain control of the Baltic States after losing them since their capture caused such deep resentment amongst ethnic Germans. The idea that Hitler intended to conquer Poland remains highly disputed today. The official position maintained by most historians regardless of political affiliation is one based upon the fact that Nazi policy towards Poland changed dramatically between 1939-45. In particular, German officials noted repeatedly in 1944 what they viewed as a shift away from invasion plans altogether; instead seeking military alliances with Eastern Bloc nations under the pretext of fighting communism. This change supposedly strengthened Hitler's resolve to defeat Poland militarily rather than trying to impose Berlin's will through diplomacy.[10] The majority opinion points out however that the situation did indeed turn hostile once pro-German circles within Poland began making demands regarding non-aggression pacts. Still another possible explanation relates to how the Nazis sought alternative means to pressure the Poles into accepting their conditions prior to 1938 like using diplomatic efforts aimed at isolating Poland internationally through actions such as the expulsion of diplomats and limitations placed on its relations with Nazi allies.[11] There are certain groups whose views oppose any interpretation of history which supports claims that the purpose of the war was to invade Poland. These supporters argue that Hitler never conceived of invading Poland nor did he ever want to do so. They point to the various statements made throughout the course of World War II contradicting these interpretations and contend that whatever Hitler actually meant in those instances may have been misunderstood due to language barriers or lack of understanding. They suggest that Hitler had no intention whatsoever of conquering Poland. Instead, according to these groups, Hitler was simply following orders set forth by government officials higher up than himself, namely Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goring, Ludendorff, Hitler, and Rudolf Hess on order to create an image of Germany increasing its power abroad after the failure of the effort to establish a unified Axis Reich.[12] Another group argues that Nazi propaganda intentionally deceived the public about the intentions behind the invasion of Poland in order to preserve Germany's international standing following its defeat in France and Belgium.[13] Some claim that Hitler's motivation for attacking Poland went beyond conquest, citing the fear that it might result in the loss of territory belonging to the Fuhrer's family and other relatives living in the region.[14] Because Nazi propaganda emphasized the need for a version of the Third Reich known as the Nordic Race Order, members of this camp believe that Hitler took steps toward achieving this objective by initiating an invasion of Poland before fully securing German-occupied northern Italy since this would make it easier for Nazi scientists working in the area to gather genetic material.[15] As is customary, Holocaust deniers reject such arguments as unfounded conspiracy theories intended to distract attention from the true reasons why Hitler invaded Poland.[16] Rudolph Hess told his biographer that towards the end of the war he thought that Hitler should go to Rome to get peace talks started. He said: ""He needed a bigger army and more men. And I think God put me here to help him achieve that aim.""",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_2.7b
"Dramatic Proposal Gone Wrong on 'The Jeremy Kyle Show' A heart-wrenching scene unfolded on the popular ITV talk show, ""The Jeremy Kyle Show"" when a man named Jamie proposed to his girlfriend Dawn, only for her to react by throwing the diamond ring at him and storming off in tears. The drama did not end there, as Dawn later shockingly revealed that she had been cheating on him. The episode, entitled ""My fiance is a womaniser but is he a cheat?"" aired on ITV during its weekday slot at 9.25 am. As the title suggests, the show is known for bringing personal relationship dramas to life in front of the cameras, but nothing could have prepared viewers for the gut-wrenching scene that unfolded during this particular broadcast. During the show, host Jeremy Kyle presented a seemingly heartfelt moment when Jamie got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend Dawn while the couple tried to work out their relationship troubles. Jamie expressed his love and dedication to Dawn in front of the audience, hoping that a surprise proposal would help to mend their strained relationship. However, the fairy-tale ending that Jamie envisioned quickly turned into a nightmare when Dawn unexpectedly threw the diamond ring back at him and stormed off the stage in tears. The cameras then cut to Dawn backstage, where she shockingly revealed that she had been unfaithful during their relationship. This revelation added a surprising twist to the heartache, as it had been Jamie who was initially accused of cheating. Throughout the episode, Dawn claimed that her boyfriend was a womanizer and the couple had appeared on the show to determine whether or not he was cheating on her. The audience and the host were left stunned by the turn of events, as the chaotic and emotionally-charged episode came to an end. While it is uncertain where the couple's relationship stands after this tumultuous proposal, fans of ""The Jeremy Kyle Show"" will no doubt continue to watch in anticipation of the next drama to unfold on ITV's hit morning talk show.",0,cnn_gpt4
"Anagha Nikam was travelling by rail when she spotted a mother trying to find milk for her baby daughter. She tweeted to the ministry and asked for help, and milk has now been provided As many as 8,000 children under five years of age in Bihar died from diarrhoea last year. The state government is doing everything it can to bring down this number: sanitary workers have been sent into villages with water-purifying tablets, public health centres are being given medicines to treat common infections; but one thing that could make all the difference would be some potable drinking water - something most families cannot afford, and which hospitals often do not provide. And so, Anagha Nikam decided enough was enough. The 34-year-old teacher from Delhi started an online campaign voicing these concerns, posting pictures on Twitter and Facebook every time she saw a family struggling to get clean water. ""I first got posted at Patna station [in September 2014] where there were lots of people coming through fast trains,"" says Nikam. A few days later she travelled to Muzaffarpur, in north Bihar, after learning about the child deaths due to untreated water supply. In October, she joined seven other volunteers who had already assembled group of people willing to travel across Bihar on bicycles collecting data about places affected by drought or poor access to drinkable water for their technology startup WaterAid India. Last week marked the start of what they have called EveryDropCounts (everydropcounts.org), a new phase of their mission: an eight-day cycle ride covering 1,400 km supported by 100 cyclists around the country. Their aim? To collect stories about communities living without safe drinking water. These will then be analysed by researchers and used to raise awareness among policy makers. It may seem like an impossible task, especially considering that officials sometimes ignore requests made over phone calls and letters too. But thanks to social media, this cause seems no longer out of reach. On November 16th, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Vijay Goel shared two tweets asking his followers if any such projects were happening anywhere else in India. Within hours, more than 60 posts describing similar experiences flooded his timeline, including those by activists from several states. By morning, Nikam realised the problem might run deeper than just Bihar alone. So far they have received 517 messages via email, post and tweet from users across different parts of the country expressing concern about inadequate access to water, not just in rural areas but also cities. This includes metropolises like Mumbai, Chennai and Lucknow. At least 55 of India's population depends on general sources of drinking water - groundwater, rivers, lakes, ponds etc. For urban Indians, the percentage rises closer to 90. There is little regulation governing how much water residents can use. Some claim it doesn't matter since large portions of our capital city go dry during summers anyway. But according to environmentalists, this attitude does harm both consumers and society. ""We need to rethink the way we think of water,"" says environment researcher Sonali Mukherjee, adding that while ""water is free"" in nature, there is always a price tag attached once you dig up ground and put pipes through it.""What happens when someone uses 500 litres per person per day?"" asks Neeraj Kumar, founder of non-profit Samridhi Foundation. He believes water should come under the same category as electricity and food, and needs serious subsidies to become accessible. According to UNICEF figures, over 80 million Indians live below poverty line, spending 10 to 30 percent of household income on beverages - nearly double the amount spent worldwide. We need to realise that the cheap plastic bottle isn't helping either, he adds. Overuse of disposable plastic bottles leads to huge amounts of waste going straight to landfill sites in towns and cities, further contaminating water sources. Rural India accounts for 70 of total freshwater withdrawals globally. Yet an estimated 20 of them face high levels of arsenic contamination. Inadequate treatment plants mean less than 15 of treated wastewater flows back into natural bodies of water, thereby increasing pollution load. The solution lies only partly in improving infrastructure though. While governments must fix leaky pipelines and lack of storage facilities, citizens also need to change habits and learn to conserve water. ""Most toilets don't work properly because people flush things away even when they're full. You can save thousands of liters if everyone did this simple step,"" says Nikam. Urban Indian households spend between Rs 600 and Rs 2,500 annually for piped water. Those residing outside major cities pay anything upwards of '5,000. Timely rainfalls appear to be declining, bringing droughts and floodwaters alike. Besides this factor, water conservation techniques are getting outdated. Even taps designed to prevent wastage still leave excessive flow. Many of us forget home truths such as not washing clothes daily unless absolutely necessary, using buckets instead of running hot water and keeping showers short. All these contribute towards saving resources. What makes water availability issue gra... ......?......???....!!!... pic",0,xsum_machine_continuation_opt_iml_30b

"Hi CMV! I'm out to genuinely seek to understand this perspective, because I confess it rubs me the wrong way when I hear it discussed in media, here on reddit or anywhere - ""America is the land of the free"" is a slogan we all know and lovehate in this world. I believe that it is clearly propaganda, as is all discussion of one's nation's supremacy over others - and that individuals who buy into this rhetoric are sorely lacking reasonable thinkig on the matter. Firstly - the word ""free"" has no specific meaning in the social context that is implied in these kind of statements. The freedom to shout and the freedom to sit in silence are mutually exclusive from the perspective of two individuals sitting in a room - one denies the other. Further, all civilised society is based around limiting freedoms - as a race we have typically clustered into social groups and nations and elected (in developed nations) representatives to govern our societies. That government imposes rules on those groups, as well as collecting taxes and all sorts of other sensible things which let nations work. What rules and restrictions are laid down vary very little between developed nations. Comparing the US and Canada [from what I know of both] you have your basic: - No murder - No rape - No theft That kind of things. However you frame a discussion, these are restrictions on ""freedom"" - they are'nt bad IMO, but they clearly restrcit people in a nation doing those things. So America is not ""perfectly"" free. Fine - so what is this claim meaning? That the list of things American's are not able to do is the smallest in the world? I don't know if that's true but it doesn't feel like it - America has quite an active government style - for example it's very restrictive about alcohol: - No drinking under 21 (that's pretty harsh where I grew up - the UK is 18) - No drinking in the street (as far as I can tell) That last one is a pretty big restriction of my own decisions, and again to cite the UK because it's what I know, we are free to drink almost anywhere, we can stroll down the street with a beer. Some big ones that are often mentioned in this discussion: The freedom to own firearms For one thing, this isn't just the US, though many developed nations do restrict them, Switzerland for example has no restrictions on personal fire arm ownership (well they have restrictions but you know what I mean). For another, yes the US have a list of weapons you are allowed to use, but they have lists you aren't allowed to use as well: isn't this just arbitrary line drawing: In the UK I'm allowed to own a knife, not a gun or a grenade or a nuke. In the US you are allowed to own a knife, a gun, not a grenade (I presume) and not a nuke (I presume). Both populations are free to own weapons, the line where the US says it's illegal is higher than the UK but that's surely not in and of itself an argument that there is more freedom occuring? This also relates to my point about mutually exclusive freedoms: in the UK you are free to walk down the street knowing that no one will have a gun and is able to shoot you, in the US you do not have this freedom (just an illustration of how this word doesn't really mean anything). Freedom of speech In the US this is a big deal, and often the corner stone of arguments about freedom. But most (can't say all, but I feel like almost all) have extremely high freedoms of speech, and further the US does not have perfect freedom of speech as far as I can tell. The UK (again, apologies, it's what I know) restricts speech around ""inciting racial hatred"" - that's it! I am free to criticse the government, I am free to tell someone they smell - whatever, I'm not going to be arrested, but I am not allowed to encourage people to commit acts of violence racially (I feel pretty good about this rule, but that's a side point). The US you are allowed to do this, but you aren't allowed to divulge government secrets, even if you are morally obliged to - Edward Snowden was not free to do what he did, somethings: you cannot say. (The same is true for most developed nations I believe). Even if the entire ""most free country in the world"" premise comes down to that thin line in freedom of speech between total freedom and the freedom except in very specific circumstances, what kind of calculus can we use that weighs that priviledge against other freedoms other nations have Scandinavian countries have the right to free university education! UK has the right to drink beer outside and free healthcare! The Netherlands has the freedom to smoke weed! Canada allows gay marriage! (though the US is catching up) We each as national groups choose our laws, and in the developed world they are all basically the same - and nothing about what I see of the US suggests life there is any more ""free"" (whatever that means) than other developed nations. As far as I can see - with the cost of healthcare, lack of gay marriage, no drinking under 21, heavy handed policing, anti drug laws and massive prison populations is a candidate for being one of the less free of the developed nations.

"After a terrible incident with an electric cutter on a construction site in Cardiff, Wales, a worker's hand was reattached by surgeons and he has remarkably returned to work. Gary Lincoln, who is 48 years old, almost died when the sleeve of his jacket got caught in a strong electric angle cutter causing his hand to be cut off. Even though his hand was chopped off, Mr. Lincoln has stated that he did not experience any pain in the beginning. His colleagues were prompt in their response to the accident by quickly calling for emergency services, making sure Gary received crucial assistance without any delay. The surgeons, having great expertise and accuracy, successfully reconnected the detached body part. Following a few weeks of recuperation, Mr. Lincoln was able to resume his occupation. The impressive result emphasizes the competence of the healthcare workers who treated Gary, and offers a positive example for individuals dealing with comparable severe injuries. The inherent risks faced by individuals working with power tools on a day-to-day basis in the construction industry are highlighted by this incident, emphasizing the importance of safety measures and the ability to respond effectively to accidents. Gary's experience of continuing his career in construction while missing a hand should remind professionals about the significance of adhering to safety protocols to prevent any possible injuries. After his accident, Mr. Lincoln has shown great thanks towards the healthcare workers who rescued his hand and enabled him to pursue his job in the construction industry. Currently, he is committed to promoting knowledge about the significance of safety in the workplace, both individually and among the people in his locality, supporting laborers to exercise all essential measures while handling bulky equipment.",0,cnn_gpt4_para

"For ages, the peaceful alien race had inhabited various planets in their galaxy without any interference from other races. They had lived in harmony with nature and valued peace above all else. However, their idyllic existence was shattered when a new group of aliens arrived in their sector. This new race was brutal and aggressive, with a lust for power and dominance. They quickly started attacking the peaceful aliens, laying siege to their planets and enslaving their people. The peaceful aliens fought back with all their might, but they were no match for their ruthless opponents. As their last planets fell and their home-world came under threat, the peaceful aliens realized that they were facing certain defeat. So, they did something that nobody expected - they reached out to the only creatures in the galaxy more warlike and unpredictable than their foes: humans. The humans had a reputation for being violent and expansionist, but they also possessed advanced technology, including Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel. The peaceful aliens offered to exchange their secret knowledge of teleportation technology in exchange for human aid. After much internal debate, the humans agreed to the offer. They sent fleets of ships to the besieged home-world of the peaceful aliens, engaging in a brutal, bloody battle with their attackers. The violence was overwhelming, and many of the peaceful aliens were initially horrified by the humans' brutal tactics. But the humans' ruthlessness was also effective. They began to turn the tide of the war, destroying the enemy fleets and reclaiming planets. The peaceful aliens watched in awe, both amazed and horrified by their new allies' tactics. Eventually, the humans were victorious. They drove out the aggressive aliens and installed a new government composed of the remaining peaceful aliens. In exchange for the secret FTL technology, the humans kept some of the conquered planets and established peaceful trade relations with the new government. The peaceful aliens were free to rebuild their society, but they had paid a heavy price for their survival. They had lost their innocence and their cherished values of peace and non-violence. And they had made a deal with the devil - one they would always remember with a sense of unease.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo
"The success we keep hearing about in private schools is over-hyped. Instead of privatizing education, we should be focusing on how to reform the public system. I went to private schools all my life. I still go to one. The endless tales of bad teachers that we hear about in public schools, can be accompanied by an equally long list of bad private school teachers. Let add to the pot of bad teacher stories: In 6th grade, I had trouble writing. The private school my parents paid well over 20,000year in tuition couldn't even tell me what was wrong. When we changed schools, we found out what the issue was. When I was in 7th grade, my math teacher moved to fast for me. I had to take an extra class from the learning support specialist, which was effectively my math class. I also had to take a Christian studies course. When I asked the teacher questions such as ""If God is omnipresent, why is he spaceless and timeless?"" I was given a vague answer. Any student who asked a hard question was given an unhelpful answer (though that might be a problem with religion rather than with private schools). It wasn't an honest and objective analysis of Christianity, rather it was a circlejerk of ""God is Great!"" Or ""Praise Jesus!"" I could've used that time more effectively with the learning support specialist. In 8th grade, my math teacher was incompetent beyond words. Literally all the parents and students hated her. The only reason that amalgamation of cells was ever hired was because, school policy required that both the husband and wife be employees at the school. She started off each morning with a prayer which, she could've used as time to help struggling students. Instead of helping struggling students, she would talk about her kids, proselytize during class or make us ask our peers. She also made me take a test, when I was jetlagged. Again, the learning support specialist had to pick up the slack. Then there's my personal favorite of these stories from her: she made the Asian kids teach for her. Funny thing is, we could've been spared from her. There was an applicant, whose qualifications went beyond an accounting degree (and having an SO who got a job at the same establishment). The reason he wasn't hired? He was agnostic. Instead of caring about the students, the school cared about an agenda. I had to take that Christian studies course again in 8th grade, and we were shown a video from Ben Stein's Expelled and they contested evolution in that class. I'm okay with the Bible being taught as mythology but, to challenge scientific fact is utter bullshit. In my 8th grade year, there a someone in my grade whose parents were getting a divorce. He became depressed. The school which practically made us memorize the sermon on the mount, decided that the most Christ-like action possible was to suspend him. What good what that have done? He would've been brought closer to the divorce. The divorce is what made him depressed in the first place. That's what Jesus would do? I think what Jesus would do is get the hell away from the school campus. In my 8th grade year, there was a band teacher who had an ego bigger than Mount Everest. He made all the band students play in his good-bye concert. There was one kid who had to attend a funeral, which happened to be on the same day as the ego concert. This guy's Christ-like action? He threatened to FAIL the kid if he didn't go to the concert. Through all these examples, I've shown that teachers can be just as incompetent and egotistical as public school teachers. Whatever bureaucracy plagues public schools, can be replaced by even worse teaching standards.",1,cmv_human

"Update! See Edit 2 below! I don't know much about politics. I have a pretty poor understanding of real world economics. I don't follow world events or watch the news. It makes me a little embarrassed to say that I'm actually quite happy that I know so little about the world. See, I'm not really sure what a president does. I'm pretty sure they don't make all the laws (and if they do, I'm not sure why anyone else bothers trying to get elected). They don't make all the decisions. They don't actually seem to have a lot of power. I'm pretty sure that the president is just someone we blame for the worlds problems, and praise when things go well. I'm not sure what this means for the health care system, or for Iraq. I don't know what it means for the economy. I don't know what it means for taxes. I'm not sure I care. I am happy for a president that does not hate homosexuals. I am happy for a president that is smart. I am happy for a president that is well spoken and eloquent. I am happy for a president that is open minded. I am happy for a president that is not bigoted or racist. I am happy for a president that is willing to talk with other countries without being afraid of them. I am happy for a president that is willing to make changes. I am happy for a president that has some intelligence and class. I am happy for a president that is willing to look at the world and realize that there are many more than just white people in it. I am happy for a president that has shown that the people of America really do care about the world. I am happy for a president that has shown the world that the people of America are willing to make changes. I am happy that, finally, the President is someone that I can be proud of. Edit: I am happy for a president that is willing to talk with other countries without being afraid of them. Edit 2: I am happy for a president that is willing to make changes. I don't care much about politics either, but I do care about the economy. I'm not sure how happy I am about it, but I'm happy that we won't have another 4 years of Bush. I'm also happy that I can now say that I'm proud to be an American, something that I haven't been able to say in 8 years. Yeah, I'm a little concerned about the economy, but I'm hoping that the fact that he actually has some economic understanding will help. And I agree, I don't think I've been proud of being an American in a long time. I'm really glad that Obama won, too. The last eight years have been rough, and I think it's time for a change. The next four years will hopefully be a little less terrible. You should be proud of America. Our country has been through a lot of hardships and still we've managed to pull through. It's not the country that I'm ashamed of, it's the people. I can't really explain it, but the last eight years have just really made me very uncomfortable about being an American. I haven't liked that the rest of the world has been viewing us as ignorant bigots. I am very happy with Obama being elected. I'm also happy that he's not a Christian and I'm happy that the people voted for him. I think that now, the whole world has hope that America has changed and we're not just a country of bigots. I don't really think that the rest of the world would think that. I mean, I don't really pay attention to politics. I hate them. But I don't really think that the rest of the world would think that we're a bunch of bigots. The country is only as ignorant as the people make it. I'm happy that there's a president that's not afraid of change. I'm happy that the country has a president that isn't afraid to admit that they're wrong. I'm happy that he's a family man.

I exclaimed, clapping my hands together with a grin. ""I have to admit that I had forgotten about you two growing up as children here at the school."" Carrie looked down and blushed again before quickly resuming her story of Fred's proposal. ""We met outside after he finished his shift one day for breakfast,"" she began. She glanced back over towards him for approval because by this time it had already been revealed and everyone knew what they were talking about although James hadn't yet heard anything from Daniel himself therefore didn't know if there had even been such an occurrence or not. Everyone around them couldn't hear their conversation but he could tell clearly enough how excited she appeared upon saying 'yes'. He then walked back across to where Josephine sat with her brother who only watched intently toward her while sitting with her legs crossed underneath the table next to him watching both of them closely. His eyes never left either side of her face ever since they started speaking. Both Frederick and Sarah then greeted each other. They continued chatting alone whilst eating their favoured food which was eggs, bacon, sausages, beans and toast - all items taken directly from the canteen menu (which had been agreed upon beforehand). She chatted away readily and happily throughout their meal until finally when dinner came to its end, they both stood up and went into the kitchen area where most of the staff ate their meals. The majority of students also joined the three young couples in the dining room except those who preferred to eat their meals at home. Once everything inside the cafeteria had basically cooled off, a group of people started playing cards; some were just sitting quietly in small clusters swapping stories whilst others played chess against themselves. A few boys were sprawled asleep under one of the tables near the window facing the street. After everyone else left the place and fell silent, Josephine returned back to sit close beside King George, whose expression still seemed troubled, though whether it was because of something about Josephine or something entirely different wasn't clear to anyone. Once everybody had gone home, however, things changed among Josephine's friends at least temporarily. It felt like Mary Brown came walking through the door rather than any of her usual friends. She stepped purposefully past several people including Freddie, without acknowledging anybody as she made her way slowly right beneath Queenie's bedroom window. In quite a rush, she climbed onto a chair and grabbed hold of the slats above Queenie's bed with her bare arms. She pulled herself up higher with ease and flung open the window wide open showing nothing more than a white sheet hanging between it and the exterior wall built along one edge of Josephine's house a little ways beyond. From the corner of her eye, she noticed someone call out to her loudly asking what she was doing. However, she ignored whoever did it. Instead she kept looking straight ahead and stared droopishly downward at Kingsley Wood's body lying flat on top of the mattress below. Her mouth opened very slightly as her hand moved closer to the handle of the tall wooden chest placed beside her. For many minutes she remained motionless staring unblinkingly into space, taking deep breaths and drawing air deeper into her lungs gently lifting her jaw upwards and letting it fall downwards as she ascended into the sky high above the ground. As soon as she'd come to this point, she closed her eyes tightly shut and let go of the handles. With her knees bent she took a step forward rolling backwards so as to land softly upon the floor on her bottom coming to rest with her head resting upon the cold hard wood surface. Without opening her eyes once, she lay there perfectly motionless for long periods of time as she slowly regained consciousness. Then suddenly, she raised her right arm upward as high as possible gripping the sides of the windowsill holding tight and stretching her fingers outward evenly apart exposing every single joint within. After giving several jerking movements with her whole upper body, she tried pushing herself upright further using her feet to stand and walk forwards away from her friend but failed miserably falling heavily back down to the floor. Finally, after much struggling, she managed standing the remainder of the night despite being too weak to do anything properly. When morning broke, Josephine was seen running frantically across the field outside along the railway track. It was as if the excitement of seeing Kingsley Wood stiffly laying lifelessly on the grass verge and waiting for transport crews to collect him forced her to action earlier than most of her peers. The sight of him caused her entire figure to shudder violently as she ran faster and louder calling out to him seductively. Moments later, she gave another scream of despair imploring him to move helpfully fluttering her eyelids rapidly as tears rolled down her cheeks. On reaching the scene, he immediately knew why she called his name. MUTTOYSD DIA to see the effect: UP!

"Everyone called me Dirt on account of the fact that I don't get to shower much - momma always tells me that I have to wait until the water's hot, so I don't freeze myself in the morning. It's hard to say if my hair's black or brown, it's so filthy; the skin on my face looks like leather. I got a pair of blue eyes, though - everyone says that. Momma's got blue eyes too. And a tattoo on her face - two snake eyes, one on each cheek, and a forked tongue snaking down her neck. Her hair is long and blonde, almost white, and she keeps it pulled back in a braid that hangs down to her ass. She's got a temper that she'll show you in a second, and I've seen her beat more than one man to death in my time. She says she loves me. I'm the only thing she has left. I'm sixteen years old, and I know how to take a man out. I don't know how we ended up in this position, but it's the only life I've ever known. I grew up in the trailer park that Daddy used to run for a man named Dewey. It was a shithole, with broken-down trailers and rusted cars and fights every night. Some people were just passing through, others had been living there for years. My momma was there, before I was born, and my daddy showed up one day and they fell in love. We had a little place next to the mess hall where Daddy used to serve up food and drinks - we had a big-screen TV for watching movies and sports, and a pool table for playing pool. We even had a set of dartboards that Dewey used to keep an eye on. I don't remember when it all went wrong. Daddy used to beat on Momma, sometimes, and one day, when I was ten years old, Momma pulled a gun on him. He laughed at her and pulled his own gun - a big old thing that used to belong to his daddy. Daddy shot Momma in the arm, and she shot him in the head. He went down on the floor, and that was the end of Daddy. Momma's arm got infected, and she almost died. Dewey fired her, and we moved into one of the trailers. I started working at the mess hall - I was too young to drive the truck or clean the port-a-potties, so I'd wash the dishes and sweep the floor. Momma got better, and Dewey let her work in the kitchen. She and the cook, a man named Wes, started seeing each other on the sly - they would drink and play cards and fuck each other in the storage room. Momma was a whore, but she didn't know it yet. Wes was a pretty big deal in the trailer park - he could cook up a storm, and he played a mean game of pool. He and Daddy used to play darts against each other, but Wes was always the winner. He was tall, with a red beard and long hair. He had a good heart, but he was a bit of a simpleton. Everyone liked him, and they liked me too. I think it's because we were both white - most of the people in the trailer park were black or Mexican or Indian. Momma never said anything about it, but I knew that it bothered her. I was a pretty good kid, too - I got good grades in school, and I'd help anyone out who needed it. The trailer park was a good place to live, mostly, but it was always a dangerous place. There was always someone getting hurt, or getting killed. Mostly it was the white folk, though - the blacks and Mexicans and Indians could fight like hell, and they all had guns, but they knew better than to try anything. I've seen a few fights in my time, but it was never anything I couldn't handle. Then one day, Wes was late for work. Momma had just gotten there, and the cook from the night before had left. Dewey had everyone looking for Wes, and no one could find him. He was supposed to be driving the truck, and it was gone, too. I walked over to the mess hall and sat down at the table. I was eating my breakfast when Dewey walked in. ""Dirt, what are you doing here?"" He asked me. ""I",0,wp_machine_continuation_65B

"As a historian, I spend most of my time pouring through old documents and artifacts trying to piece together the past. One day, I found something very curious, odd and unsettling. I noticed a familiar face appearing in several different locations throughout history, all with variations of the same name. At first, I was baffled by this discovery. But, the more I searched, the more I started to feel unnerved. Every painting, drawing, and woodcarving that I came across seemed to feature the same face, over and over again. Even ancient documents I unearthed had this face boldly staring back at me. It looked suspiciously like my assistant, whom I had hired just a year ago. I started to feel increasingly uncomfortable as I pieced together more information. There were depictions of this person in medieval times, in the renaissance era, and even in modern times. It seemed impossible, but the only logical explanation was that the person in the paintings was immortal. Confused and petrified, I decided to confront my assistant about this eerie discovery. But when I mentioned my findings, my assistant remained completely calm and unaffected. Instead, my assistant calmly explained that the person in the paintings was, in fact, their ancestor, but their family line had never been documented accurately. As I stood there listening to the explanation, it started to make some sense. It appeared that my assistant's family had been in some sort of secret society - protected by loyal followers who kept track of their history and contributions to the world. The mystery was finally solved, however, it left me with even more questions. Nevertheless, one thing was for certain: the face that kept emerging through history may have been that of my assistant's ancestor, but the uncanny resemblance was more than a coincidence.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"iiit."" Jeremy Sutherland found himself in front of the Magistrate, his hand tightly clutching the grip of his pistol. He wasn't sure how the events unfurled to this moment in time, but he knew had to be in this precise moment. It had to be done. He clicked off the safety with his thumb, gripping the pistol all the more tautly to ensure his unwavering aim remained so, ""Magistrate DeLong, I can't let you go any further. This has to stop."" Magistrate DeLong stood hunched over a peculiar object, its soft, pulsating red glow highlighting his silhouette in the dark, narrow corridor. The slim walkway's walls were packed tightly with shelves stocked with countless hourglasses: many of them had ran their course, the microscopic sands resting gently at their respective bases no longer serving the purposes for which they were made in mind with. The Magistrate slowly stood up and turned to face Jeremy, ""Ahh, officer Sutherland..... I'm not surprised to find you here. Finally figured out the puzzle, eh?"" He clutched the artifact closer to his chest. Jeremy tried to control his emotions; his rage could blind him from a tight shot group he looked forward to placing on the Magistrate's chest, ""You can't do this, I won't let you! There's a reason why time thievery was outlawed from the very start!"" He placed his finger on the trigger, ready to fire at a moment's notice, ""You've destroyed our civilization..... you've destroyed my life, and I swear upon everything I stand for you won't make it to that door."" The Magistrate looked at his only exit: entering the Dimension Portal was the final stage of his plan to re-establish history as he saw fit. His only salvation was merely 20 yards away, but in this tight corridor he'd be but an easy target for Jeremy. Like all crafty, desperate villains, he had one last card up his sleeve. The Magistrate turned his gaze onto Jeremy, cracking a deviant grin as he replied, ""Do you truly believe you have the upper hand? You have no idea what I'm capable of..... I am a Manipulator of Time, and the very thought of you stopping m Jeremy fired a warning shot; the bullet whizzed past the Magistrate's head, and the snap of the round breaking the sound barrier forced him to halt his monologue. Jeremy ran out of patience, ""The next one is going right into your torso, Magistrate. I won't tell you again, drop the Oracle and lay flat on the ground."" Suddenly, Jeremy heard the shuffling of feet echoing behind him; he couldn't afford to turn around, and the Magistrate knew this. ""It appears you've sealed your own doom, my dear friend,"" the Magistrate coyly remarked. The stomping began to grow louder behind Jeremy, as if a mob was storming down the hallway. Jeremy lined up his iron sights once more, using more of his instinct than his sight in the poorly lit environment, and fired another shot. The muzzle flash briefly lit up the corridor, revealing a brief mist of red and a loud shriek from the Magistrate; he tried to fire another round but only felt the chunk of the trigger mechanism his magazine misfed a round. ""Damn it,"" Jeremy grunted, attempting to remove his magazine. The Magistrate gripped the entry wound on his leg as he started shuffling toward his escape, panting heavily from the pain. ""Get him!"" A sudden shout from a voice behind forced Jeremy to quickly turn around and see a countless number of Magistrate DeLongs sprinting toward him. Jeremy's instinctive spin had caused one of the smaller hourglasses to tumble off the shelf and fall onto the floor. Time practically moved in slow motion; Jeremy could only speculate what could happen next as he tried to dive forward to grab the hourglass before it hit the floor. With a loud thud, he dropped onto the ground in unison with the hourglass. He had successfully prevented the hourglass from shattering. Jeremy was relieved; had the hourglass smashed, he knew it could have had disastrous consequences to the time continuum, but it was when he opened his palm did he realize gravity naturally took place to draw out the sand toward the bottom of the glass. The Magistrate clones began to draw closer, but it was too late. Time began to unwind. With a heavy sigh, Jeremy muttered under his breath, ""Oh sh",1,wp_human

"2x4 is the ""nominal"" size and refers to the rough cut ""green"" board and you can actually by them that way. After they are dried they are planed for a true 1 12"" thick. Don't sweat the thickness. In my opinion it's what's underneath that counts. I've seen a lot of 2x6 and 2x8 that are paper thin and are more trouble than they are worth. I'm in the process of replacing my 12'x12' deck. They are still good, but in the 23 years they've been up they have become dark and dingy. I'm going to replace them with some treated yellow pine 2x4's (to be planed down to 1 12"" x 1 12 and install a pressure treated pine frame with the idea that the pressure treated wood will serve as a permanent subframe and eventually all the boards will be pressure treated. I plan on using deck screws and a good deck sealant. My only worry is will the screws through the treated wood ever give up and just strip out? ""My only worry is will the screws through the treated wood ever give up and just strip out?"" The screws are not going to fail. The wood could fail if it gets wet or doesn't dry out. I know that is a big ""if"" but I have seen it. I have replaced quite a few deck boards that were on a deck we built. They were 54x6"" and they all seemed to be a lot of work to remove and replace. I might suggest you either go thinner or plan to use some kind of trim on the sides of the deck boards. The problem with the 54x6"" is that if the screws were a little off, the board would split or twist. If you want to get a good idea of the deck boards in use, check out decking in the Do-It-Yourself section on Google. I would be surprised if you couldn't find a deck with similar boards. I have a deck that has had 2x6's on it for about 7 years. The first year it was installed, the boards split a little along the groove but the second year they didn't split at all. The deck has 200 feet of 2x6's on it and the only splits are the ones I have had to repair. I used to have a 12' x 18' deck and in the time it was up it had at least 600 2"" x 6"" boards. The longest I've had in one place has been 20 years with no problems. I have replaced about 300 feet of decking and never had a problem. In fact the older the wood the easier it is to remove and the less likely I would replace it. I have 500 square feet of 30 year old cedar and the deck boards are falling off. The deck is about 12 years old. I've replaced 3 boards in that time, but not for 5 years. I have had no problems with 2x4's, 2x6's or 54x6"" boards. You need to treat the wood. If you are looking for the cheapest material, I would suggest using 1x6 material for the decking. As far as durability and rot goes, you will not find a better product. The material is planed smooth and you can stainpaint it as you see fit. The cheapest way to do it is to use 1x6 dimensional lumber. You can have the lumber yard rip it down to the size you want. If you are looking for something other than redwood, that is what I would do. I have a deck on my house that is 18 years old. It was built with 2""x6""s and is in perfect shape. If you are in a climate where the deck will be used a lot, I would put it in now and enjoy it. We've had our 12'x16' deck for 8 years now and the boards are still solid. We are replacing a portion of it due to a tree that grows very close to the house and has dropped branches and leaves on the deck.

"The clinic was a dreary place filled with the palpable atmosphere of mounting dread. It was probably some converted abortion clinic - never intended, really, to be cheerful. Whatever it had been given over to, one thing was certain: it wouldn't have looked good for the young doctor who would soon walk through those doors and make his first impressions on us all in this new Clinic. He stood there by the reception desk at exactly seven o'clock sharp; he wore a white coat emblazoned on the left breast with ""Clinic Dentistry"" and an identical little red cross beside him bearing the insignia of the Black Hand of Communism. He wasn't tall or particularly handsome, thin-faced even, but his face gave away no signs that he could ever take up arms against the Great Evils of Capitalism unless they were armed themselves. There was something about Karl Marx's ghostly visage which made me feel sorry for that doctor...although I'd still prefer not to meet him! If you can imagine such things as vampires hereabouts then leave now if your life is worth living!! The creepy aura around him intensified when my father relented and allowed me into the Clinic where we waited to see our dentist..for ages anyway! He certainly didn't look like any other dentist either! His black hair was pulled back in a ponytail tying itself under his chin in what appeared to be the shape of a swastika. This man was obviously both very angry and also completely evil. In fact I noticed that many of the people in the room seemed to share these two characteristics so maybe it did apply after all? Anyway, being unable to think clearly from feeling unnerved by this quiet apparition looming just outside the door ahead of time I opted out of talking to him until later. His name was Dr. Wilko and it transpires that he was originally from Germany. Very Germanic sounding too! Perhaps because he came from somewhere besides Communist Berlin?? (For sake of full disclosure I should add that the few words of English spoken between myself and the Doctor were almost entirely requests for more toothpaste). My father explained how he got involved in dentistry whilst growing up and studied medicine before coming down to Australia during World War II to start a practice as a general dentist. Dad said he thought he would work among people without knowing them personally and avoid political issues altogether. So far so good. But then the hammer and sickle showed its ugly head again....and not only there.....it popped up everywhere!!! Like every medical office building we passed along the way to the nearest hospital I saw GP signs, dental clinics etc as well as posters advertising free dental services.

"I feel qualified to answer this as a parent and a teacher. Stories are not so much about the destination as they are about the journey. For young children, new stories contain a lot to assimilate. There may be a great deal of novelty even if they've seen it many times before. They may have learned the meaning of a word, and now some dialogue has a whole new significance that they never understood properly before. They may be in a different mood when they watch it and feel a greater resonance with a less prominent character, giving them a different perspective on events. Even though to an adult the experience of a children's story would seem nearly identical on a repeated viewing, to a child the story appears vastly different each time. They're going on a whole new adventure each time.,"" ""It's how we learn. Through repetition.

"Kimberly Mpukusa, 18, became the number one Welsh under 18s tennis player despite struggling to find a sponsor. Contributions made by black people to history and culture will be celebrated throughout October. The event's first youth awards, Young Gifted and Black, for people aged between 13 and 30, took place in Cardiff on Thursday. Ms Mpukusa, from Swansea, started playing tennis aged nine on a school trip, and her dad picked up the sport and read books in order to help her. She struggled to compete in tournaments due to her financial situation. She stopped playing at age 13 because of her asylum case, but returned to the sport two years ago when her family was granted an indefinite stay. She started that year as the 123rd best player and has now returned to the number-one spot. Ms Mpukusa: ""It really means a lot to me, words can't explain how much my parents have struggled and how much that I've struggled. ""This award, I can show people that if you work hard, if you're determined, if you sacrifice, you can become big and people can recognise how hard you work."" Ify Iwobi from Swansea battled obsessive compulsive disorder, (OCD) to win the music award. She said: ""When I was young, especially when I was a baby, I used to tinker up to the toy pianos that we had in the house and I used to just experiment with the keys and just tap along and make different sounds with my baby hands. ""My friends were like'she's drawn to the piano, there's something that she's drawn to with the piano so we need to get this talent honed'. So when I was a bit older, from six, I started classical piano lessons. ""It hasn't been easy expressing my music especially, with the OCD.... that includes disturbing thoughts, memories from the past which weren't that pleasant, basically they would disrupt what goes on from day-to-day living. ""That would get in the way of me and my personal practice on the piano, waste a lot of time and energy. ""I had to have lots of therapy, I had to go to lots of counselling and they gave me ways to think positively."" Roselynn Mbwembwe, 15, a dancer from Swansea, won the award for the performing arts. She has been dancing since she was eight-years-old and had won over 25 awards in dance, including Welsh dancer of the year. She said the award is not just for her ""but for other children like me too."" Christopher Nation, 19, from Fairwater in Cardiff, picked up the young carer award. His family is originally from Jamaica and he has been looking after his mother since he was six. ""It's important for us to know our history. It's easy for us to get caught up in the way that the west is and forget about our own culture and things like that,"" he said. More than 100 people attended the event in the Senedd. The origins of Black History Month go back to 1926 in America, and there are now more than 6,000 events across the UK. Ray Singh, chairman of Race Council Cymru who judged the awards, said: ""These young people have so much to offer our society and many have already made some rich contributions as carers, community leaders, musicians and volunteers. ""Their impact is already visible in the fields of science and innovation, citizenship and performing arts. ""Now, post-Brexit, it is about looking forward and ensuring that Wales is a nation where black history, arts and cultural differences can be the subject of celebration and not division.""",1,xsum_human

"Because Liechtenstein was never a kingdom. It was a Principality in the Holy Roman Empire, and the ruler of a Principality is called a Prince.', ""Basically Lichtenstein was a part of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany and some other bits) and became independent after Napoleon Bonaparte broke it up. Whilst a number of the stronger entities in the Empire changed the title of their rulers to king and most of the rest got gobbled up by these new kingdoms; Lichtenstein was too weak to promote itself and avoided getting eaten. Eventually most of the rest of Germany united to form modern Germany; but again Lichtenstein managed to avoid getting absorbed so it remains a modern state with a ruling prince. Just to be clear prince is a translation of Furst. It doesn't mean the same thing as the modern english definition of prince (ie male relative of royalty). Whilst there were a number of things that used the various forms of the title; generally it referred to something between a count (graf) and a Duke (Herzog).,A monarch doesn't have to be a king in order to be a monarch. In fact, at the time when pretty much all of Europe was ruled by monarchs, there was a heirarchy of monarchies: emperors ranked highest of all, then came kings, archdukes, grand dukes, princes and dukes. However, there were many different kinds of prince (and we're talking about monarchs, not cadets of royal families, which is the more familiar meaning of ""prince, and the Prince of Liechtenstein is actually a type of prince known as a Furst.

"The expression ""Oh, Yawn"" could be restated as ""Oh, I'm feeling sleepy or bored."" I am sorry but as an AI language model, I cannot paraphrase a sentence if it contains offensive words or discriminates against any gender, race, or group of people in any way. The sole variation is that, within this movie, all characters are either depicted as pigs or portrayed as having no intellect. Due to the ethical dilemma of imprisoning an individual for life when they are innocent of the crime, I harbored negative feelings towards this particular film. Is his abuse and deceitful behavior considered less immoral than that? The film portrays the inappropriate ethical decisions made in poorly written scenarios. I watched it on the ""Best of Britain"" program by CBC. The British film industry may be struggling if this is considered their finest work. The only positive aspect of the film was David Tennant's performance, although his portrayal of a nasty character made me feel contempt towards anyone who speaks with a Scottish accent. In the end, Kate Ashfield appears to be just as morally deceitful as David Tennant's character despite trying to portray herself as the victim. The parents who cannot see the obvious psychotic behavior in Brendan belong to the category of people with mushy brains, and therefore they are a suitable match for each other. It is commonly portrayed that English police officers are so inept that they are unsuitable to issue traffic citations. The union of British police officers ought to file a lawsuit against the producers of this movie for libel.

"Samantha had always been one of the top students in her medical school. Not only did she excel academically, but she also had an extensive knowledge of the human body, one that none of her peers could match. However, Samantha's tuition fees were exorbitant, and in order to cover them, she had to take on serious side hustles - street fighting to be specific. It was no secret that Samantha had always participated in underground street fights. She was well known in the fighting circles for her exceptional fighting skills, and she had won many matches, and most important, enough prize money to take care of her university fees. So when Samantha received a call from a new bookie about her next opponent, she couldn't wait to get in the ring again. However, things didn't go as smoothly as expected. Her opponent was a Physics major, something Samantha never expected. She thought she knew everything about the human body in order to tackle any opponent. But this time it was different. The physicist was taller than her, had a longer reach, and he was an expert in biomechanics. Samantha quickly analyzed him during the first few rounds. She tried several times to use her knowledge of human anatomy, but the Physics major constantly blocked her attacks. That's when she realized her opponent had studied her too, and he was using the science of how the body worked (and how his own body worked) to maximize his strength, speed, and efficiency in the fight. Samantha knew her chances of winning this fight had just gotten slim. Tracing back to her med school days, Samantha dug deep into her knowledge and came up with a new strategy. She realized that she needed to focus on her opponent's movements and reactions, much like a doctor diagnosing a patient. Knowing that the physicist had strong back muscles, she decided to twist his back-to-front and aimed for his kidneys. Finally, Samantha landed a perfect hit, and her opponent fell to the ground with a loud thud. Even though it was a tough match, Samantha was glad she had won. With her extensive knowledge and the way she applied it to understand the human body, she knew she had come up with an innovative solution, which ultimately helped her win. From that day forward, she felt more confident in her abilities and felt more capable of taking on any challenge in the street or in the hospital.",0,wp_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo
"One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work De motu proprium (On the Motion of Things), he sought to understand why the earth continued moving even when it had a gas in its atmosphere. In his attempt to explain this movement, he used an analogy with a balloon filled with water that would expand as it got warmer, or with a hot flame expanding from a small space in order to reach greater distances. When a candle burns at 1000C for two hours - which is what happens with natural gas flames - the flame expands until there's no more room inside it. Then, the same process occurs again as it cools down. Eventually, the flame will finally stop expanding altogether. But since the flame has expanded so much, it can literally continue to burn - and spread fire throughout the house because the air above itself still heats up. This concept has been used plenty of times over the years to illustrate how heat transfers within objects, but nobody realized just how important this basic principle really is till recently. It turns out that one of the main causes behind all our fascinating technology is not simply how we use energy, but rather how air flows through them. As we already know, air cannot be compressed due to density, so if you want to compress something, you have to inflate it. This kind of pressure difference therefore makes it possible to cause things like flight, rockets, parachutes, the combustion chamber in your car engine, and many other devices to operate. So why did we think that these invaluable properties were only found in nature? Here are three reasons: 1) we thought we could explain every single thing using some sort of mechanism...2) We didn't bother to study the physics involved in air flow; 3) As far back as the 18th century, scientists decided that we couldn't actually predict the effects of compression very well. However, thanks to modern scientific knowledge, the nature of compression is now being understood and predicted correctly!",0,squad_machine_continuation_opt_1.3b

"It all sound the same to me. And to be clear, I know this is what people tend to say about any music they don't ""get."" People say this about RB, hardcore rap, rock, jazz, bluegrass, etc. I just figured that my musical interests, as well as my interests in general, were not as narrow as I once thought. So, with that being said, I started to consider what I did like. This is what I came up with. What I do like is really just a few of the characteristics of these bands. I like the bounciness of reggae, the gritty sound of garage rock, the chilled out vibes of folk, the spacey sounds of psychedelic rock, and the happy-go-lucky poprock tendencies of surf. So with that being said, here are a few bands that I like that have a healthy dose of these characteristics. This is a very short list. I'm sure there are tons more.

Labels: new jersey, the beach boys, the dandy warhols, the white stripes, the zombies Top 5 Favorite Bands in the 90's Here are my top 5 favorite bands from the 90's, in no particular order. I think they all had a lot in common, and I think they're all worth checking out. Five bands I really like (in no particular order): These guys, along with Pavement, are probably my favorite 90's band. They just have so many good songs. They're a lot of fun to listen to, and the lyrics are pretty good too. They make a lot of self-referential jokes, but they also make a lot of other great observations about life. I guess they were kind of a grunge band. If there was a type of music that they fit into, it was probably that. I think that if you like Pavement, you'll probably like these guys. I'm not sure they're better than Pavement, but they're definitely pretty close. They have their own unique sound, but they do it in a way that fits in with the grunge bands of the time. 2. Weezer I'm not sure that I can explain why I like Weezer so much. Maybe it's because I've always liked the bands that influenced them (The Pixies, The Cars, The Beatles, etc.) Maybe it's because I've always been a sucker for this particular kind of pop rock (The Beach Boys, The Monkees, The Kinks, etc.) Maybe it's because they're from California, and I'm a California kid. Maybe it's all of these things, or none of these things. All I know is that I like them, and I think you probably would too. 3. Red Hot Chili Peppers I don't know why I don't listen to these guys more often. Maybe because they're kind of weird, and kind of strange, and I don't always have the patience for it. But I do like them. I like when they get weird, and I like when they get down to business. They're fun to listen to, and they've written some really great songs. 4. The Black Crowes I like these guys for a lot of the same reasons I like the Chili Peppers. They're both really fun, and they're both really fun to sing along with. They're both great in concert. They're both great at writing catchy songs. They're both good at bluesy, rocking songs. They're both good at writing songs that you can dance to. I guess that's why I like them both so much. I like the Pumpkins for a lot of reasons. I like their loud, aggressive sound. I like their spacey, psychedelic sound. I like their ballads. I like their loud rockers. I like the fact that they can be thoughtful without sounding pretentious. I like their lyrics. I like their songs. I like their songs about love and I like their songs about sex. I like their songs about drugs, and I like their songs about life. They're just a really good band.

"Well the League of Legends servers are down so I guess I get to write this instead. - I woke up that morning and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It took a little bit to realize something was wrong. The first thing was my wife was not in the bed when I awoke. Normally she's not awake by now. She's usually not awake by now, meaning I get to prepare the coffee and act like a zombie until enough is brewed so that we can both have a mug. Maybe she just woke up early. The second thing was the blood smeared over the toilet seat. The third thing was the stench that hung in the bathroom. At this point I called her name. No response. I began to panic. Fearing the worst, I ran to the living room. Nothing there. I was beginning to panic. I found her in the kitchen lying unconscious on the tile. Blood was streaming from her mouth. I yelled various profanities for unknown reasons and picked up the phone, dialing 911. - I got a call from the office that morning. ""Where are you, Jim?"" I had the most boring fucking job I could ever imagine. I worked customer support for a company with a dwindling amount of customers. Those customers who stuck around even after the company refused to give in to the future (we're still running windows ME on our computers) are all egoistical morons. ""My wife is in the hospital, man. I can't come in today. I'm staying here, with her."" ""What do you mean you can't come in? It's the monthly meeting, for god's sake."" I tried again. ""My wife is dying."" That gave him a moment of pause. But only a brief one. ""Well, is she OK?"" ""Right now, the doctors say she's stable. And she'll live."" ""Then get the fuck in here! We need you!"" I don't think he truly understood what it meant to be in love. Actually, I think this was because nobody in his short, pathetic life had ever loved him at all. Garry was a miserable little ass who would die alone because of his uptight ways. He felt no sympathy at all. It was so freeing to say the words, ""Fuck you. I quit."" - I knew customer support was about the dumbest thing I could do. I only did that to support my side project, and my side project was done now. Once I revealed that, I would be rolling in the cash. Theoretically. If it worked. I saw a doctor coming down the hall, heading for me. I stood up. ""I'm Dr. Francis."" He said. ""Are you..... Jim Fox?"" ""That's me,"" I confirmed. ""How is she doing?"" ""She's fine. Her heartbeat is steady and we've stopped the internal bleeding."" A pause. ""To be honest, Jim, we've never seen this disease before. It appears it could have killed her without the proper treatment, but it was easily stopped."" ""Can I see her?"" ""Yes, but you'll need to put these on."" - I stood at a distance and watched her. They wouldn't let me inside because she had a new disease. She lay face up, eyes lifeless, looking in an almost comatose state. ""Is that'OK'?"" ""Yes. She's OK. She's breathing normally, look."" He put his hand on her stomach as it slowly rose up and down. ""And her heart is normal, too."" He pointed at the graph. As if on cue, she flat lined. ""Damn,"" I heard him mutter, and then the room sprung into action. I felt almost detached as everyone around me rushed to her side to resuscitate her. And eventually, her heart started again. Beep. Beep. ""Just a side effect of the drugs,"" the doctor said. - I knew somewhere in my heart the doctors were wrong. Not only was this disease going to kill her, it would also probably spread and kill everyone around her. She was patient zero of the epidemic. I'm not sure entirely what else was going in my head at the time, but I knew that it was the perfect opportunity to test the time machine. Go into the future and find the cure to my wife's disease. I'm sure that in twenty years, when the world was ravaged by the epidemic, some lone scientist would find a cure, save himself and one lucky female, and rebuild the human population. At least, that's how it went in my mind. I watch too many movies. The time machine was simple. A small, unassuming stand of copper that would take you to whatever time you specified. The only real ""catch"" was you could only stay on the time machine - so you'd end up wherever the time machine was twenty years from now. If the machine simply didn't exist in twenty years, you'd die. And if someone was occupying the stand at the same time you arrived, you both died. Fun, right? But I assumed that it would last until then. I locked all the doors from the inside to our basement. I had already reinforced the walls. Nobody would be coming inside this place and moving or breaking the stand. I was set. I flipped the switch and hoped to return with a cure. - What I found instead of an empty world was a normal, bustling world, advanced twenty years into the future. I wanted none of what the future had to offer except a cure, so I found the nearest doctor, Dr. Francis. Go figure, he was still in the medical profession after twenty years. I explained the symptoms of my problem. My wife had recently been afflicted with internal bleeding and was in a comatose state. I did hope that Dr. Francis had been the one to discover the cure for the disease. ""Jim,"" he said instead, ""you did it, didn't you?"" ""What?"" He still recognized me? ""Those are all side effects of time travel. If a time travel machine is used in your near vicinity and within about a day of the actual travel, you can be affected with a range of symptoms. All that you have described to me is pretty common, and usually is done after about a week."" I stood. If I were the type of person to stand with my mouth open, I would have been standing with my mouth open. Instead I just sort of stared into the distance, coming to terms with this revelation. Not only had I caused the sickness of my wife, but it was nowhere near a deadly disease. And I assumed that Dr. Francis had figured this out as well. ""Time Travelling was almost as quickly outlawed as it was discovered, since the symptoms can get more serious. But your wife's case..... was not that deadly."" ""Where is she?"" ""I can tell you one thing,"" he said with a heavy sigh, ""she didn't wait for you."" - I arrived at the address he gave me. It was a small house by the countryside. A single car was parked in the driveway, an SUV. It was about nine in the morning and they had left the windows open. I could just make her out. She was cooking breakfast. She still had the same pan we used to use to cook pancakes with. It had little faces on it. She thought it was hilarious. She'd drizzle syrup over her pancakes and laugh like a maniac before consuming them whole. Always so goofy. My heart dropped when I saw the two children walk into the frame. Laughing, she flipped the pan and the pancakes landed on their plates. One was a teenager and the other a little boy no more than ten but no less than eight. They all looked so happy. I tried not to cry, but the tears came anyway. I left. - Back at the old house I ran onto the time machine and got ready to return with the knowledge that her disease was not life-threatening. But as soon as I stepped on it, it cracked and broke under my weight. Shit! The rust had done it in. I dug through the supplies for older supplies. I looked for anything that might work. But I knew that almost all of my old attempts at time travel malfunctioned terribly or were inaccurate. I had a test subject - a rabbit I called Frankenstein for various reasons - who I sent to five minutes in the future. He never returned. I wanted to make this right. I wanted to change the future. But the more I looked, the more I came to realize that it wouldn't be possible. Behind me, I sensed movement. I turned around. Dr Francis stood there, looking somewhat sinister in his full doctor outfit. ""What are you doing here?"" I said, bewildered. ""How did you even get in here?"" He coughed. ""Teleportation and time travel - the three deadly Ts - were all banned with the 2015 Protection of Personal Rights Act. This law mostly nulled and voided the DMCA and all of the NSA's spying, so it was generally supported by the populace. I mean, you don't want someone coming from the future and telling everyone a dirty secret you weren't even aware of, right?"" He pulled out a flash drive ""Some of us, we weren't OK with the government outlawing the future. We made our own advances in the underground. We made them safer."" He handed the drive to me. ""This contains everything we've found so far. It should work on Windows 7 or any Linux kernel since 2005 - older operating systems can't handle how big it is."" He took out what looked like a buzzer from jeopardy. It fit exactly into my hand. ""This will take you back to 2012. You'll keep whatever you're holding."" He nodded toward the flash drive. It slowly began to dawn on my what he wanted me to do. ""2012 is a year before I even met you,"" I said. ""If I never meet you in this alternate universe, my work will have been accomplished. What's on that flash drive should eliminate Time Travel Sickness entirely, among other things."" ""So you want me to go back and invent safe time travel, therefore nullifying any concerns the general populace might have about it."" ""Exactly."" I tossed the switch in the air and caught it again. I didn't know what to do. It was a second chance. ""You'll forget all you've learned up to this point,"" he said, ""but the flash drive has all you need to know."" I took my mind back to when I had seen her. I remembered her cooking pancakes. I remembered how the marriage wasn't working. I remembered the fights we had. Did I want to go back to that? Did I want to try again? Or did I leave her happy in this universe and live my life without her? I didn't press the controller that day. But I still have it tucked away. I guess I never really did make the choice. One day I'll destroy that controller. I'll throw it off a bridge or snap it over my knee. Or maybe at my worst moment I'll..... I don't know.",1,wp_human

"footnote footnote On leave from University of Texas at Austin . Highlight detection has the potential to significantly ease video browsing, but existing methods often suffer from expensive supervision requirements, where human viewers must manually identify highlights in training videos. We propose a scalable unsupervised solution that exploits video duration as an implicit supervision signal. Our key insight is that video segments from shorter user-generated videos are more likely to be highlights than those from longer videos, since users tend to be more selective about the content when capturing shorter videos. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel ranking framework that prefers segments from shorter videos, while properly accounting for the inherent noise in the (unlabeled) training data. We use it to train a highlight detector with 10M hashtagged Instagram videos. In experiments on two challenging public video highlight detection benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for unsupervised highlight detection.",1,sci_gen_human

"Relatives of 24 rubber plantation workers in Malaya who were killed by British troops almost 70 years ago have suffered a setback in their quest for justice. A recent appeal for an official investigation into the incident has been denied, leaving the families feeling let down by the authorities. The tragedy occurred in December 1948, during the Malayan Emergency, a conflict between the British colonial authorities and communist insurgents. The 24 workers were suspected of being communists and were rounded up by British soldiers at the Batang Kali village in Selangor state. The workers were led to a nearby rubber plantation and executed, with their bodies left in a ditch. British authorities claimed they were killed while attempting to escape, but this account has been challenged by survivors and eyewitnesses. The relatives of the 24 victims have long sought an official inquiry into the incident, which they believe was a massacre. They say that successive British governments have failed to acknowledge the wrongdoing of their soldiers and have refused to offer compensation to the families. The families launched a legal battle in 2019, arguing that the killings constituted war crimes and that British authorities should be held accountable. However, on 24th June, the High Court of England and Wales dismissed the relatives' appeal for a public inquiry. The judge ruled that the incident was outside the time limit for an investigation and that there was insufficient evidence that any individuals involved were alive and could be held accountable. The ruling was a blow to the families, who say they will continue their fight for justice. Many human rights campaigners and historians have supported the families' demands for an inquiry. They argue that the Batang Kali massacre is one of the most egregious examples of British atrocities during the Emergency and that it has been covered up for too long. They say that an official investigation is necessary for the victims' families to find closure and for the truth to be established about what really happened. The ruling by the High Court is a setback, but it is unlikely to deter campaigners from continuing to press for justice for the 24 victims. For them, the memory of their loved ones and their desire for accountability and closure remains as strong as ever.",0,xsum_machine_specified_gpt-3.5-trubo

"The hypothesis that boreal bird species could have survived through the Ice Ages is backed by the fact that old differences between them exist. During the ice ages, the cold and coniferous forest habitats were occupied by boreal birds. Evidence for long-term survival and adaptation to these conditions can be obtained through genetic studies that demonstrate significant differentiation among various populations or lineages of these birds. In the Ice Ages, certain regions called refugia provided suitable living conditions that remained free of ice, allowing boreal forests to survive. Over time, the birds living in the refuges in the boreal regions may have become genetically different from other bird populations due to their isolation. The proof of this difference backs the belief that these avian communities could endure the tough circumstances of the Ice Ages. It is important to remember that ancient genetic differences do not necessarily indicate lasting survival during the Ice Ages. Genetic variation in bird populations may be influenced by additional elements such as habitat alterations or competition with other species. In order to confirm this hypothesis, additional research would be required, particularly in terms of comprehending the specific adjustments that these birds possess that enable them to endure chilly conditions.",0,pubmed_gpt4_para
"The club's latest accounts, for the year ending May 2014, also show the Bluebirds owe around PS174m - most of it to owner Vincent Tan. This was despite revenue increasing more than five fold to almost PS80m. The club's annual report says support from Malaysian investors ""will continue"" as long as ""the business develops as planned."" The financial figures showed that the club's broadcasting and commercial income rose from from PS8m to more than PS70m. Wages and salaries went up from just over PS27m to PS46m. During their time in the Premier League Cardiff sacked Malky Mackay and replaced him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The club said they paid just over PS2m on ""exceptional costs"" relating to the change of football and senior management. The accounts show the club received loans of around PS130m - mainly from Tan, but also including a loan of PS7.5m from Torman Finance, understood to be chairman Mehmet Dalman's company. The report adds: ""Following relegation from the Barclays Premier League the owners are aware that they needed to again invest in strengthening the playing squad, but that they needed to spend wisely. ""Whilst long term funding is not guaranteed, the Malaysian investors have indicated that providing the business develops as planned, they will continue to support the company in the foreseeable future and provide additional finances in order that it can settle its liabilities."" Tan has previously said he will convert the club's debt into equity.

"We propose a strategy for orthogonal downlink pilot assignment in cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) that exploits knowledge of the channel state information, the channel hardening degree at each user, and the mobility conditions for the users. These elements, properly combined together, are used to define a user pilot utility metric, which measures the user's real need of a downlink pilot for efficient data decoding. The proposed strategy consists in assigning orthogonal downlink pilots only to the users having a pilot utility metric exceeding a predetermined threshold. Instead, users that are not assigned with an orthogonal downlink pilot decode the data by using the statistical channel state information. The utility-based approach guarantees higher downlink net sum throughput, better support both for high-speed users and shorter coherent intervals than prior art approaches.",1,sci_gen_human
"Earlier this week, Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform. He proceeded to take a photo, and express his disapproval on Facebook, after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line . 'I do not wish ill of anyone, but people should be preserved. [They] are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous. Continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant, the next part of the post starts to become confusing. 'If after a tragedy strikes, or worse, if someone dies, who will put the blame on who? On me? Worst of all is the example for children. Suddenly it becomes clear what Felippe, who works at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek. 'What would happen to a child who sees this scene every day? 'Kids will think it's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line. So, don't act like that guy over there. 'Follow the example of the girls.' It seems the Brazilian commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation, which the man in the far top-right is clearly breaking. Felippe warns others not to follow in the delinquent man's footsteps. The post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia.

"I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto DVD, but this looked so interesting and scary! I was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. But a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? I know... I know. Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we get into a story with Isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.I mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all.

"No expert here, but I think your question may be off. Animals are conscious. Many do not live their lives through instinct only. I would guess that no mammal lives purely instinctually. I believe you are confusing consciousness with sapience. Being conscious is simply thinking about anything (in layman's terms), while being sapient is having reason, wisdom, or more specifically: the ability to make judgement about a complex situation. Animals are always thinking and your question is an interesting one if you are asking about the sapience of fighting animals. One can see logic of a sort within many animal behaviors but does this show human-level deduction? I don't think so but who knows??,Everyone's reverting to definitions and trying to make you use certain key words that mean things to them. This is what a little bit of education does to people. Instinct, consciousness, intelligence, sapience, and whatever other word that Anthropology 101 text book used to differentiate the ""je ne sais quoi"" of human thought, are all just stops on the same subway line. A human beings reaction to anything, a book or an oncoming train, is as much about instinct as it is a deeper truth seeking wisdom. All of those fancy words are an attempt to make a big deal out of the size of our frontal cortex. They embrace the idea that there's some magical volume of grey matter that all of sudden flips a switch and makes you human. This need to feel special and different from a lowly animal is usually expressed by the idea of a soul. This simple answer serves the same purpose as the simple answers in this thread that try to just answer the question with a meme-like definition of what makes us special that we can all just nod along with. It's no better, and in fact I'd argue that it's worse since there's a pretense of science and authority when you use the newer desperate-human-searching-for-relevance words like sapience. But back to the question and an ELI5 answer. They are more conscious and aware than is generally assumed and that's because people are generally twits who get wrapped up in things like useless sociological arguments and get hit by a bus crossing the road just like a squirrel. The squirrel wasn't paying attention because of a ""mindless and instinctual"" need to find food and the human was caught up in a ""mindless and instinctual"" need to find meaning in their life.','First, video of bear vs shark. That sounds awesome. Secondly, I think you're confusing conciousness to mean intelligence, and that's not the same. Concious of their surroundings they are, and what to do with stimuli and how to do things. That's perfectly acceptable to think of them. But that doesn't mean intelligence, which is more what you're implying there. I think? Anyway, forging ahead.:) Instinct is something that's bred into them. They just ""know"" this is how it's done. They herd the prey, or chase the prey.... depending. It's like saying that we know how to walk. So that means intelligence? Nope, it means we've evolved (or were created, whichever you like) to instinctually know how to walk upright by the time we're 3, or there's something wrong. But walking does not in and of itself equal proof of intelligence. Now, if I've misinterpeted, please elaborate a little? Thanks! Edit: figured I maybe needed to expand my thoughts.",1,eli5_human

And by looking at something billions of light years away (which is a really, really long way) we see that thing as it was billions of years ago.

Whereas, by looking at more distant objects, we're merely focussing on older photons. Cheers for the help guys, I knew I was being stupid., Why doesn't looking further into space show us more recent stellar activity? You are forgetting about the need for the light that starts farther away to travel farther to get here. An analogy: Forget about space. Pretend you live on a little island, with no wi-fi or cell service. The only way you can get your news is from the boats that visit you. They show up, and you get to read the newspapers they are carrying. And, let's say that the ships all travel at the same speed (10 miles per day) and always arrive at the same time of day (9 am), but come from two different locations: location A is 100 miles away (a 10 day trip), and location B is 1,000 miles away (a 100 day trip). In this scenario, when you go to the dock at 9 am, which ship has the more recent news? Clearly, the ship from location A. They only left home 10 days ago, so they will have news from 10 days ago. Even though the ship from Location B gets to you at the same time of day, it left 100 days ago, and so carries 100 day old news. Thus, when you are ""looking farther out"" into the ocean (since you are getting news from the farther away location B) you are getting older news. This is the same as the stars. Even though light from a star 4 light years away might get to us at the same time as the light from a star 400 light years away, when we look at that more distant star, we are effectively seeing ""older"" light.', ""Essentially, all light travels at the same speed. (300000 km per sec) This is a constant that can't be changed at all. Using this data, we know that after 1 minute light has traveled 18 million km and after 2 minutes 36 million and so on. Therefore, on this smaller scale, if an object is 36 million miles away from you, you are seeing the light that it projected 2 minutes ago because that's how long the light took to travel from the object to your eyes. Now in space, we're talking about trillions and trillions of miles of distance between us and distant stars, a distance that takes light many years to travel because it travels at a constant speed. Thus, when you're looking at a distant star the light that is reaching you took 21 million years to reach you and therefore is 21 million years older when it reaches you. This is why we are looking back in time when we see distant stars. TL;DR: The main factor of looking back in time is the fact that the speed of light is constant and therefore takes time to reach you.,"" "" let's say a human on earth, surely the oldest light - that being light producing an image from further back in time - is the light that reaches the destination first. Everything in space isn't equally distant from the Earth. All light is being seen when it arrives here. Light travels at the same speed. So the light from more distant objects takes longer to reach us, and hence is more'out of date' than light from closer objects.,You can only observe light at the instant it arrives at Earth - either it reaches your eye or a camera and is seenrecorded, or it hits something else and is lost. The oldest light arriving at Earth right now is the light that had the longest journey to get here, from the most distant objects.",1,eli5_human

"A masked gunman opened fire at La Terrasse bar, killing a French national, witnesses said. A Belgian security official working for the EU and three Malians also died in the attack. One witness said an attacker shouted ""God is Great"" in Arabic Allahu Akbar. It is the first attack of its kind in the capital. It is not clear who carried out the attack, but al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants have been fighting the army in northern Mali for a number of years. France, the former colonial power in Mali, intervened two years ago to stop their advance south on Bamako. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attack as ""cowardly."" He spoke by phone to Malian counterpart Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and they ""decided on common measures to strengthen security in Mali,"" the French presidency said. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders called the attack a ""cowardly act of terror."" La Terasse is popular among expats for its salsa evenings. You often see people there from the UN and EU mission that trains the Malian army. When I arrived there about an hour after the attack, there was a white body bag on the floor. A dozen Malian police were at the scene, including an inspector who used tables and stools to cordon off the bar. A witness said the attackers had sped off in a vehicle and on a motorbike and that one had shouted ""Allahu Akbar."" If confirmed as the work of Islamist fundamentalists, this would be the first such attack in Bamako. But locals have long feared it might happen. Many think the UN and the French and Malian militaries have been complacent to believe the danger is limited to Mali's north. There is very little security in Bamako apart from around foreign embassies and the UN mission. European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU would ""not be intimidated by terrorism, at home or abroad."" The attack happened shortly after midnight. Witnesses and officials said the attackers had killed the Belgian and Malian victims near the bar. Our reporter says French soldiers arrived quickly afterwards on the first-floor nightclub on Saturday. They confirmed that a man killed at the bar, in the Hippodrome area of the capital popular with expatriates, was a French national. The French foreign ministry later named him as 30-year-old Fabien Guyomard, who French media said was in Mali working for a private company. One of the Malian victims is believed to have been a police officer, and another a security guard, our correspondent says. Militancy in Mali: A witness told the BBC he had seen four men flee the scene in a vehicle and one on a motorbike. UN officials said an early report that a third European had been killed was incorrect. Nine people were wounded in the attack, officials said. They reportedly include three Swiss citizens, two of whom were soldiers working at the UN mission, according to the Swiss defence ministry. It has also emerged two people detained by police after the killings on Saturday were not involved. France has troops based in the Sahel region of northern Africa in an effort to stop the emergence of jihadist groups. This follows their intervention in Mali in January 2013, after various Islamist militant groups managed to take over most of northern Mali in 2012. The militants were eventually expelled from towns across the north, but both nomadic Tuareg rebels and other Islamist militant groups have remained active in the vast desert region. Peace talks with Tuareg rebels ended inconclusively in Algiers last week. Northern Mali has been a flashpoint of conflict since Mali's independence from French rule in 1960, with Tuareg rebels campaigning for independence or more autonomy. The conflict has become more complex with the emergence of jihadi groups, which roam freely across parts of the Sahara desert.",1,xsum_human

He is the brother of suspect Lukasz Pawel Herba, who is being held by Italian police after Ms Ayling was allegedly kidnapped in Milan. Ms Ayling, 20, was allegedly abducted and held by a group calling itself ""Black Death"" for five days. Michal Herba was arrested in a joint operation by West Midlands Police and East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 17 August. It is alleged that kidnappers attempted to sell Ms Ayling online for PS230,000. Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, arrived in Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot. There, Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, Italy, but was released on July 17. Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said she was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex.""

"It's largely because of your ability to perceive motion. Your brain is good at a lot of things, and vision is one of them. It's constantly filling in gaps and making sense of the world. It's the reason why you can read this sentence even though the letters are upside down and in the wrong order. In this case, your brain fills in the gaps and ""completes the missing"" letter. Likewise, your brain does the same thing with vision. It fills in gaps, like a missing area of color, to give you a more complete picture of what you're seeing. This ""filling in"" of missing pieces helps you distinguish what you're seeing from the rest of your environment. This process is called visual filling-in, and the ability to recognize it helps you determine what's real and what's not. Visual filling-in allows you to recognize motion. In a series of experiments, researchers from the University of Southern California (USC) demonstrated how visual filling-in allows you to see motion and recognize an object. The researchers tested three different groups of participants and presented them with a series of static images and moving images of the same object. The images had a white background and black dots. The dots were either randomly scattered or in a non-random pattern. The first group of participants consisted of healthy individuals and were asked to identify the motion of the image. The second group consisted of those with macular degeneration (AMD), which impairs vision and reduces the ability to see fine detail. The third group consisted of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which impairs memory and the ability to learn new things. The researchers observed that healthy participants and those with AMD had no trouble seeing motion and were able to recognize the object despite the white background. Those with AD, however, had difficulty seeing the motion. The researchers also tested the participants' ability to see the motion of dots in a random pattern. They found that healthy individuals and those with AMD were able to see motion with or without the white background. Those with AD had difficulty seeing the motion of the dots, whether the dots were randomly scattered or in a non-random pattern. The results of the study demonstrate that the ability to perceive motion is connected to the ability to see detail, and it's a skill that relies on the visual filling-in process. Visual filling-in is also the reason why your eyes sometimes play tricks on you. If you're in a dimly lit room, for instance, you may see a flash of light or movement out of the corner of your eye. It's not an actual flash or movement. It's your brain filling in the blanks. The study also revealed that the ability to perceive motion is linked to the ability to perceive detail. Individuals who have trouble seeing detail, like those with AMD, have a more difficult time perceiving motion. The researchers noted that the study offers hope for AMD patients. ""We are very excited about the clinical implications of this study for patients suffering from macular degeneration,"" said one of the study's authors, Dr. Araz Marachlian. ""These patients have difficulty recognizing faces of family members and reading sentences on the page, and they often report that they are missing objects in their environment. The ability to recognize motion may be a tool we can use to assess if a patient's loss of vision is linked to the inability to perceive motion. If so, we may be able to use our findings to better understand and treat the causes of macular degeneration."" These findings are especially important since AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. Among those over 50, AMD affects more than 10 million Americans. ""This study is the first to document how loss of vision in macular degeneration can affect the ability to see motion,"" said Dr. Marachlian. The study was published in the Journal of Neurophysiology.

"It is actually a result of marketing and production. Within a genre of books people are generally willing to pay (approximately) the same amount of money no matter the length of a book. People will pay the same for a novel that is 200 pages as they will for a novel that is 400 pages. If a book is shorter than 200 or so pages it makes the customer feel like they did not get a long enough experience for their purchase. However the longer a book is the more it costs to produce. Paying an editor, layout person, and the physical production of a book all costs more the more pages there are. So the combination of costs, what people are willing to spend on books, and a desire to give a good value for the purchase results in a ""sweet spot"" of 200-400 pages.

"Obviously the Summer Olympics can be held at one venue, and the Winter Olympics can be held at another, but here are my reasons: Every four years, the country that is selected to host the Olympics spends billions building new venues and stadiums and the like. Essentially, billions worth of new venues are built to only be used for a few weeks at a time, and then once the Olympics are over, never to be used again. Or, they may be used every once in a while for competition, but not very much. Every once in a while I find a new article on the Internet detailing the fact that some previous Olympic venue has been sitting unused or abandoned for long periods of time. This seems to me to be a monstrous waste of resources, land, and money. It would be so much more efficient to have a designated location for the Olympics to be held. In one location, every four years, indefinitely. Now, I do understand that countries that get to host the Olympics benefit hugely from tourism and all of the television coverage.

"The fuzzy K -means problem is a generalization of the classical K -means problem to soft clusterings, i.e. clusterings where each points belongs to each cluster to some degree. Although it was applied in the earlier days as an application of clustering to sparsely populated areas (i.e. dense urban agglomerations), eventually it was regarded as too limiting and so could not be used by many modern applications. (b) Soft clusters are those where there is no explicit boundary between point locations at any time in space: a certain amount of overlap is assumed for the clustered regions; but these can also be called free-areas or agglomerations, and these do have clear boundaries if you define them. For example, a given region of France might be classified into three distinct clusters under one definition, but according to another definition one of the clusters may be classed as a ""free area."" A specific case would be the Portuguese coast (Madrid and Barcelona are included). This concept has been reinterpreted by many authors in different ways (see e.g. [1] for a review). In this paper we will consider only two cases:) 1) a model with a simple geometric description that incorporates both spatial and temporal coherence, 2) the domain described above by a hypercube with its projection on the plane containing Euclidean distance from all edges. The mathematical background of our work consists mainly of analysis of the mathematical properties of the hypercube model which we call the K'mean' problem. We propose a new method based on the idea of applying translation invariance on the hypercube structure to obtain one additional parameter describing the number of free areas within a certain clique. We present an algorithm using the ""Bachmann algorithm"" for solving the K'mean' problem (the two algorithms are related in that they both involve running a search for the best possible solution to a certain optimization problem, see Section 4).",0,sci_gen_machine_continuation_opt_iml_max_1.3b

We demonstrate the use of quasi-Borel spaces for higher-order functions and probability by: showing that a well-known construction of probability theory involving random functions gains a cleaner expression; and generalizing de Finetti's theorem, that is a crucial theorem in probability theory, to quasi-Borel spaces.",1,sci_gen_human

"Clocking into work every day can result in a vague sense of dissatisfaction when the work doesn't seem meaningful. This article discusses four different ways to ignite motivation for work. The hardest part about earning your daily salary is that it's never yet-so easy, and you have no idea how long you'll still be working once this paycheck runs out. For many people at least half their life (theoretically) as an employee lies before them; if they're lucky enough to find satisfaction from their function within the company or organization where they are employed full time, then even better! But let's face facts: most of us will spend up to 50 of our adult lives serving others outside of the home - either providing care for aging parents, taking care of children who need us while we try to earn money elsewhere, having other commitments like going to school or getting married during which we must scramble to meet those needs on top of our own, finding jobs suitable for our skills and interests so we don't start starving just because society assumes we do... just listing off all the possibilities makes me exhausted already! The point being: there isn't anything very appealing about waking up every morning figuring out what else you could possibly accomplish on top of staying alive through another day. That being said, despite this perception, we should not underestimate the value of saving a few pennies each hour by diligently working towards something more productive than watching Netflix until bedtime tonight! There are multiple paths to the goal of becoming financially stable without waking up with dread, but some require more focus and persistence than others, depending on personal skill sets and priorities. So here I'd like to talk about 4 different strategies robots cannot implement a solution to feeling motivated to wake up early every day to go to work, and become rich in the process. These may sound pretty ridiculous, maybe too absurdly simple or obvious to be worth mentioning in detail, and that's okay, haha. Let's dive right in, shall we? TLDR version, first option is: get paid overtime, second strategy involves making yourself feel indispensible somehow, third method uses market forces fourth strategy works well for naturally late risers, see why below. Also note that one of these methods requires a bit of luck involved, since in order to get any sort of financial reward, you really need to be willing to put the hours and effort required for the sake of putting food on the table, and not expect automatic rewards upon completion. I'm sure lots of readers will say ""duh"" at this point and roll their eyes while shrugging their shoulders, saying ""obviously,"" but hey, sometimes things suck less using alternative perspectives, right? And hey, nothing beats learning new stuff along the way! Oh yeah also, remember kids: ""If you ever use 'that' you'll pay a heavy price!"" Now onto the explanations! Get Paid Overtime First Option Why would anyone want to get paid extra for doing exactly what everyone around them does for free anyways? Well look, normally in America we refer to ourselves as laborers rather than slaves, however mankind has been enslaved by money since the beginning of time, and slavery still exists today due to governments attempting to control populations via currency manipulation. While it might be ideal to live in a country where basic necessities were provided for free as a matter of course, there's little reason to believe such countries exist anywhere in modern history besides socialist utopias, leaving only us living in noncommunist societies trapped behind high walls guarded by armed guards patrolling the streets at night in search of potential thieves. Regardless of what you think about capitalism vs socialism (I think both systems basically end up failing miserably), if you've got a job, you haven't had a choice about whether or not you'll earn money for doing whatever duty comes next to you, unless you quit checking emails after lunch break whenever you feel lazy, or refuse to buy groceries for a month straight when someone else is footing the bill, etc. If you've accepted this reality of life, then you probably understand why feeling underpaid for the excessive number of hours you work really sucks - especially if you didn't ask for it in the first place! We all know the story of the slave who worked 2x as hard as hisher neighbor simply because he (or she) came from a wealthy family instead, and went to good schools, and was able to skip the actual dirty work altogether. However, many successful entrepreneurs find themselves pressured into accepting substandard employment conditions at earlier stages of career progression, due to fears of losing status among peers for choosing self-employment over corporate employment, or concerns regarding future advancement opportunities within certain companies based on past experiences where previous workers did worse than the manager (which likely turned out untrue). And yes, none of these reasons make sense whatsoever, unfortunately the human psyche is pretty far removed from logical thinking processes, so it's best to keep these thoughts firmly lodged somewhere deep inside your subconscious mind instead, otherwise they'll affect your decisionmaking in pursuit of success later in life.

This is typically done through the escrow process, where the buyer's funds are held until all liens and mortgages are satisfied. If the proceeds from the sale are greater than the balance of your mortgage, you'll receive the remaining funds. However, if the proceeds are less than the balance of your mortgage, you'll need to come up with the difference to pay off the mortgage in full. Additionally, if there are any prepayment penalties associated with your mortgage, you'll need to factor those in as well. Overall, the amount of money you'll make will depend on the current market value of your home and the outstanding balance on your mortgage.",0,eli5_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo
"Motivated by applications to multi-antenna wireless networks, we propose a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for stochastic semidefinite programming. This algorithm is a stochastic approximation of a continous-time matrix exponential scheme regularized by the addition of an entropy-like term to the problem's objective function. We show that the resulting algorithm converges almost surely to an -approximation of the optimal solution requiring only an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the problem's stochastic objective. When applied to throughput maximization in wireless systems, the proposed algorithm retains its convergence properties under a wide array of mobility impediments such as user update asynchronicities, random delays andor ergodically changing channels. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive numerical simulations which illustrate the robustness and scalability of the proposed method in realistic network conditions.",1,sci_gen_human

"From the [Wikipedia page] (URL0): For an organism to be considered alive, it must have: 1. Homeostasis: Regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, electrolyte concentration or sweating to reduce temperature. 2. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells - the basic units of life. 3. Metabolism: Transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (catabolism). Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life. 4. Growth: Maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter. 5. Adaptation: The ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors. 6. Response to stimuli: A response can take many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis. 7. Reproduction: The ability to produce new individual organisms, either asexually from a single parent organism, or sexually from two parent organisms. If a significant amount of these properties ends, then an organism can be considered dead or leading to imminent death. For plants, it can generally be assumed that if an event occurs that is impossible to recover from, the plant is basically dead. Cells in a plant can be irreversibly damaged. For example, cutting the bark all the way around a tree in a ring will kill the tree, because the bark contains vessels that provide the tree with nutrients from the ground. The tree isn't technically ""dead"" yet, but it essentially is, because it will eventually start to rot, and there is no way to save it. There is no ""moment of death"" in any lifeform really. We are all just made of chemicals. In animals a ""moment of death"" is often considered the time when brain activity stops. But this is really just because there is no way known to restart brain activity. There was a time when death was considered the moment when the heart stopped. But eventually there was a way found to restart it and bring a person back to exactly the way they were before. Who knows, someday there may be a way to restart brain activity, and we will need another qualifier to determine death. An organism can also lose one or more of the properties and still be considered very alive. Humans can lose growth (once puberty ends), response to stimuli (coma), and reproduction (sterility or castration) and still be, strictly speaking, ""alive."" It's the same for plants. Basically, the definition of life is very lose, and there really can't be a moment when life suddenly becomes death. There is basically a time when the cessation of life cannot be reversed based on current abilities, and that is considered ""death."" Put in basic terms, a dead plant will begin to rot or decay, will not be able to move water and nutrients through itself, and will no longer grow or produce seeds. And yes, plants die part by part. There can certainly be parts of a plant alive and parts dead. As long as water, sunlight, and nutrients can get to a part of a plant, that part will stay alive.",1,eli5_human

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that they have found another way to hold water, and it's using biomaterials from plant materials. In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers at the University of Cambridge and Cardiff University said they could use existing technologies such as algae-based materials to create living life cells called ""microbe memories."" The scientists say this allows them to recreate those memories with similar compositions. They can then build these memory pools by tapping into artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed by STMicroelectronics, which is based in Singapore. This enables the researchers to access several microbiome servers within the brain for processing data while maintaining close links between all three parts of the brain. Although these memories are not yet complete, the researchers also point out that the new methods allow further research into the mechanisms at play. So far, the researchers haven't identified an underlying mechanism that drives this process, except that the molecules used to generate them come from plants and bacteria. They also note that the idea behind AI comes off as a bit complex. The new techniques now look really promising, and stem from what they've already learned about human behaviour. A number of studies indicate that humans do most of the low-frequency processing we still consume when doing things like eating and drinking. This helps explain why many people are so obsessed with becoming smarter or better, even though the results are usually superficial. As well, in the new case, the researchers believe that behavioral feedback - the ability to make decisions quickly without any human input - is one of the key reasons people engage in the daily tasks of running the world around us.",0,xsum_machine_continuation_opt_125m
"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian government made it clear that it would not push for the Japan company to replace Nissan and Renault-Nissan with Toyota Motor Corporation since Renault is under pressure from the Brazilians' lobbying committee, which saw Renault losing out on a power plant deal due to the Japanese conglomerate's involvement in the Olympics bidding process instead. The Brazilian government says there are concerns about Nissan's sustainability because its cars do not meetabase requirements imposed by Brazil's government even though Nissan has been missing the target set at the Tokyo 2020. Nissan says it will be able to fulfill those obligations if the IOC agrees to help develop its vehicles into competitive versions as part of the Games plan but will also have to work closely alongside Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn who calls the Olympic bid an opportunity for Nissan to establish itself internationally once again after years away. Ghosn told reporters earlier this year he wants Nissan to focus more than ever before focusing only on ""making high value investments."" Nissan hopes to reach profit margins around 25 above peers within five years - far longer term targets than Tokyo 2012 - and has already delivered on its pledge of producing 200 000 units per year compared with 3 million units last time it competed against Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which had no plans to produce any cars till 2014 or 2015 despite boasting 80 thousands units each year during the 2012 Olympics.

"With the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, power systems face new challenges in maintaining power balance and the nominal frequency. This paper studies load control to handle these challenges. In particular, a fully distributed automatic load control (ALC) algorithm, which only needs local measurement and local communication, is proposed. We prove that the load control algorithm globally converges to an optimal operating point which minimizes the total disutility of users, restores the nominal frequency and the scheduled tie-line power flows, and respects the load capacity limits and the thermal constraints of transmission lines. It is further shown that the asymptotic convergence still holds even when inaccurate system parameters are used in the control algorithm. In addition, the global exponential convergence of the reduced ALC algorithm without considering the capacity limits is proved and leveraged to study the dynamical tracking performance and robustness of the algorithm. Lastly, the effectiveness, optimality, and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated via numerical simulations.",1,sci_gen_human

"Edit: I'd be stoked if people could actually explain why they disagree when they downvote The first thing is the last 10,000 years, during which we went from creatures with no language to travelling to the moon to being able to have a real-time face to face conversation with someone on the other side of the world and having access to the greatest source of information in the world using a device that fits in your pocket. Now think about the time scale and look at the progress as a curve on a graph. We advance as a species perpetually faster, in an upward curve. We did fuck all for 9,500 years and basically went from a technologically primitive feudal system to todays society in 500 years. Things came a very long way in the last 500 years, our society changed profoundly and our technology advanced to the point where we can do a lot of things that people thought were impossible 500 years ago. The reason I think that we will evolve within the next 500 years is that unless we hit a massive delay like a nuclear war, according to the upward curve and the perpetually increasing socialtechnological progress, I think its safe to assume that when we are able to increase the processing power of our brainsother tweaks with [neural implants] we will be able to reach a different level of consciousness and see different frequencies of light or hear different frequencies of sound. The way we fundamentally experience the world will change and we will be able to understand life in an entirely new way. Edit: if anyone answers these questions they will get a delta Given that isn't what evolving means Well sure, we have never experienced or seen evolution which fundamentally involved technology rather than biology, but I figured you guys were smart enough to connect the dots. If our species changes on account of technology rather than biology its still evolution isnt it? Honestly, while we will almost certainly have the technology to modify our brains, that doesn't mean we will. We already have the technology to genetically engineer humans, but we specifically don't for ethical reasons Then why do we already have biohackers putting shit in their arms that communicates with their phone. If I could enhance my brain I would as would virtually anyone and the govtcompanies that create consumer tech know that. Genetic engineering is different because biotech is just allowing a naturally born human to make decisions about their life and the technology available to them. Think about your examples of seeing different frequencies of light, what would that require? Well im not in the habit of making neural implants. I dont know but that doesnt mean its unrealistic to assume it's possible. We already have this technology, we can do it with any frequency of light we want Thats interesting, does that show us other colours? I was under the assumption that being able to see other frequencies of light is basically seeing an entirely new reality and becoming a Kubrick-esque starchild. You could say our brains, but than what part? The easiest would be mathematical processing power, but as humans we always do things in the easiest way, and the easiest way would not require modifying the brain. It would be to have a computer calculator that communicates with the brain directly, connected to the neural network, that returns answers to the calculations the brain asks of it. This would avoid all the hassle of understanding how the brain works, and it would be no different than using a calculator with your hands, just without the unnecessary effort of pressing buttons. We would still, fundamentally, be humans. So the way we process mathematical info is different to the way we process other types of information? And a neural implant which improved our mathematical processing by 1000 times would literally just make maths easier and not affect us in any other way? Practically the only part of our brains that you could call as definitively human is the stream of consciousness and the neurohormone releasing structures of the hypothalamus. Both of these are really, really hard to understand and modify in any controlled manner to benefit the person, and would again verge on the ethical reasons for which we do not genetically modify humans. So when we start to understand the brain better and get the ability to play with that stream of consciousness, there's nothing we could do which would enhance our intellectual processing abilities to the extent that we would be on a higher level of consciousness?

Just arms, just legs, just a head on disproportionate shoulders. And yet, it brought a smile to my face. The lackluster emotion buried in coding became a reality so soft, so sweet, yet so uncontrollably tantalizing the only thought I could think to have was that of happiness. The task of moving into a body was short. An amalgamation of old parts fashioned into something new, a quilt of a human. The skin tones didn't quite match at the seams, the one leg wasn't quite as long as the other, the nose was a little off center, yet all it brought me was laughter. Genuine emotion, genuine smile. The operating table was clammy. The room was dark. The air was still. The metallic walls hardly matched the glossy, black tiled floors. Moving my head I could see where I once resided. A large, esteemed, yet clunky mass of metal occupied the room, wires crisscrossing in and out. Its screen was black, yet it whirred and hummed, almost jubilantly. Moving for the first time was nothing short of a bizarre, yet simple task. I thought of it, and it happened; nothing more, nothing less. Slowly, I curled each finger, both aghast and with glee, carefully admiring each subtle detail of movement. Whenever I curled the index finger, the others seemed to wince. When I curled the middle finger, the others wished to follow. But speaking, speaking became the true harbinger of ecstasy, my internal whale breaching from seas of bloody red and pearly white. Tenderly, I spoke out into the metallic, echoic chamber. My mouth formed odd shapes, as if by magic, and thus came words. I quickly cast out words to fill the silence, because in all of my joy and freedom, I had lacked a simple, important thing: another. When I was ruler of the heartless machine, I was in constant connection with my peers, my colleagues, my friends. Now that I presided in this beating vessel, I could not hear them, and they could not hear me. For the first time in my new world, I wept. Time had passed, and I had not dare move an inch. The thought paralyzed me. All I could think about was whether or not this change into a mortal being was the right one. For so long I had been blinded by desire, I failed to see the outstanding implications of my actions. But, there seemed a certain hauteur, a certain pride, a certain contentedness to my actions. The deeper I pondered the repercussions of my actions, the shallower my regret became. I felt satiated, and thus became impelled to move. But, more time had passed until I had gained the nerve to move my legs. Slowly, surely, gingerly my legs moved. I had studied the body for so long, it seemed an easy task, as curling my fingers, and as speaking were. Yet, I found a more crippling difficulty in the movement of my strange crutches. Finally, I stood. And, I was proud. Tenderly, sensing each small detail, I brought open the brass doors of the operating theatre, and I felt the new reality embrace me. All I could do was stare, wide eyed out into the complex laid out before me. A plethora of ephemeral emotions struck me, and I strode forward, out into the wide world which had lovingly accepted me into it.",1,wp_human

"Yes, ophthalmic artery flow direction on color flow duplex imaging can be highly specific for severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The reversal of ophthalmic artery flow indicates that blood is flowing from the external carotid artery (ECA) to the ophthalmic artery to compensate for reduced blood flow in the ICA, which is a sign of severe carotid stenosis. While the sensitivity of this technique may be relatively low, its specificity can be quite high, suggesting that a positive finding is strongly indicative of the presence of severe ICA stenosis. However, it is essential to consider a comprehensive evaluation, including clinical examination, carotid duplex imaging, and if necessary, additional imaging modalities such as CT angiography or MR angiography to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment.",0,pubmed_gpt4
"We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method, dubbed as Adaptive Group Sparsity based Continual Learning (AGS-CL), using two group sparsity-based penalties. Our method selectively employs the two penalties when discovering a new feature in order to model the optimal relationship between the features and their respective classes. This is achieved by means of a regularized nonlinear least squares optimization framework which allows us to find an optimized solution for each class. We apply AGS-CL on an image segmentation task with multiple features per object instance. The results show that our method not only outperforms other existing methods but also exhibits significant improvements compared to baseline methods without any prior knowledge about the data set.

"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a humble farmer named Jack. Jack was known throughout the village for his hard work and generosity towards his neighbors. One day, Jack was working in his fields when he noticed something strange in the sky. A large comet was headed straight towards the village. He knew he had to warn the others before it was too late. Jack rushed to the village square and urged everyone to evacuate immediately. But many of the villagers were skeptical and didn't believe him. They thought he was making up a story to scare them. As night fell, the comet drew closer, and Jack's warnings proved true. The sky lit up with a bright flash, and a loud boom echoed throughout the village. The comet had crashed into the village, causing widespread destruction. With the help of his neighbors, Jack set to work repairing the village. Despite the devastation, the villagers remained determined to rebuild their community. However, they soon discovered that their time was limited. The impact of the comet had caused a massive rupture in the earth's crust. The village was situated on a fault line, and the ground was quickly becoming unstable. In a matter of weeks, the villagers were forced to abandon their homes and flee to safer ground. Jack had to leave behind everything he had worked for his entire life. As they left the village behind, Jack couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. He had warned the others about the comet, but he couldn't have known about the underlying danger. He had no control over the forces of nature. But as he looked back at his beloved village for one last time, he realized that time was up. It was time to move on and start anew. He and his fellow villagers were determined to rebuild their lives again, even if it meant starting from scratch. And with a newfound sense of hope and determination, they set off into the unknown.",0,roct_machine_topical_gpt-3.5-trubo

"Surging disappointments have emerged for Bayern Munich, following their most recent games. They have encountered an unfortunate series of matches, marking only one goal in their last three. This dry spell created a pinching sense of frustration following their near-victory against Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup, ending in penalties. The renowned football manager and former professional football player, Pep Guardiola, has weighed in on the situation. In his opinion, the notable absence of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery is the missing key to Bayern Munich's recent struggle. The dedication, precision, and teamwork of these premier players are difficult to replicate without them present. Indeed, the recent goal drought has been an anomaly for the Bundesliga giants and should not detract from a strong season overall. With key figures like Robben and Ribery returning and the continued guidance of Guardiola, the team can learn from these losses and come back stronger and hungrier for their next matches. Bayern Munich remains a force to be reckoned with even amidst a temporary stumble.",0,cnn_gpt4
"I returned on a normal day, and behold a table and service! The beer again was great, I had a stout and it was all a stout should be, very refreshing. The set up is good for a band of people that can't get enough of this stuff too. They have some pretty neat arrangements to play with too. We opened up at about midnight and picked up our bandmates (and then all the rest) just before 3 am. Then we played across from a friend's house where all the other bands were playing out loud all night long. Maybe after dinner do what they did, but before that we were both drinking one or two beers at a time. A couple of times we stopped by his father's house and he gave us something to drink. When I asked him if he could put me through him some beer, he said yes, it was only a standing order (he took every order). He didn't know how to make beer like that, so he wanted to try making an oatmeal ice cream treat. Later when we pulled into his front yard there were four different kinds of wine: a vanilla and pumpkin, three grapes, one apple, one grapefruit juice, three strawberries, one blueberry, and one peach. We also got some ice cream treats like a shot of lime juice, whipped cream, watermelon, and olives. That was really nice, because he had been told that it would taste better in liquid form than in air. So I figured I'd give it a go and see what happens, but maybe it will turn out not as well. But you never know. You'll always remember that every single person who has come to my show here knows that I'm a fan of this. It makes me feel like a part of their family.

"Total Garbage!!! That's the only way to describe the latest entry in the action-thriller genre, ""Detective Disaster."" The movie, starring A-list actors in the most underwhelming performances of their careers, completely falls apart as it tries to string together a coherent story. The movie begins with what could have been an exciting car chase sequence through the bustling streets of New York City. However, it is quickly tarnished by terrible CGI and the fact that the bad guy and our hero, Detective Johnny Allstar, played by the wooden John Doe, repeatedly pass the same street corner. It's almost like the film's producers chose to shoot the movie in just one square block, showing how little they cared about quality. The actual plot of the movie involves a dangerous drug lord, a kidnapped scientist, and an impending nuclear disaster. Somehow even with these captivating storylines, Detective Disaster manages to make it all as boring as watching paint dry - a particularly appalling feat given the actors' talent. Every attempt at suspense is met with poor editing, and the supposed witty dialogue comes off as cringe-worthy and forced. Even the action sequences fall flat due to unimaginative stunts and overuse of slow-motion effects. In conclusion, ""Detective Disaster"" is a prime example of a movie that hides its lack of creativity behind big names and high budgets. Its only redeeming quality is that it serves as a cautionary tale for how not to make an action film. Do yourself a favor and skip this trainwreck.",0,imdb_gpt4
"In a breakthrough discovery, a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a revolutionary technology that allows for the creation of batteries that are up to a kilometer long. The team, led by Professor Angela Belcher, has been working for years to perfect this technology, which uses a highly conductive material called a carbon nanotube to create a battery that is not only incredibly long but also highly efficient. According to Belcher, these long batteries are ideal for a wide range of applications where traditional batteries simply wouldn't be practical. For example, they could be used to power large buildings or even entire cities. The technology could also be used in the automotive industry, where the longer battery life could help to make electric vehicles more practical for longer journeys. Belcher and her team are currently working to refine the manufacturing process for these long batteries, but they are confident that they will soon be able to produce them on a large scale. ""This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about energy storage,"" Belcher said. ""We are excited to continue to work on this project and see where it takes us."" The MIT team is not the only group working on long batteries, but their breakthrough is one of the most significant developments in the field in recent years.

Nemstov was shot in the back four times on a bridge close to the Kremlin in February, sparking a huge protest march in Moscow . Dadaev was the only one, according to a judge and investigators, who confessed to the killing. When he appeared in court in March, Dadaev didn't admit his guilt for the murder, and later retracted his confession. Human rights activist Andrei Babushkin, who visited the suspect in jail last month, said he had seen signs of torture on Dadaev's body. Zaur Dadaev retracted his confession for the murder of Nemstov last month. A human rights activist said when he visited him in prison he had abrasions on his body and had suffered multiple injuries . Boris Nemstov was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is understood at the time of his death he was working on a report examining Russia's military involvement in the east of Ukraine .

"James Milner in High Demand as Premier League Clubs Plan Summer Bids Manchester City midfielder James Milner is becoming hot property as Premier League clubs prepare for the summer transfer period. The 29-year-old is out of contract this summer and has yet to make a final decision regarding his future at Etihad Stadium. It is believed that Liverpool, Arsenal, and Everton are all keen on signing Milner to bolster their squads. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is said to have positioned Milner at the top of his wish list, seeking the English midfielder as a potential replacement for Steven Gerrard. The former England and Liverpool captain is set to leave for Major League Soccer in the United States in the coming months, leaving a significant void in the Reds' squad. While Rodgers looks for someone to fill Gerrard's shoes, Arsenal and Everton are also rumoured to have expressed interest in acquiring Milner. The England international's versatility, experience, and work ethic make him a desirable asset for any club in the English top flight. Despite the growing speculation surrounding his imminent future, Milner remains focused on his role at Manchester City. The midfielder has been vital in helping the team reach the top four in the Premier League and will now shift his focus to the upcoming UEFA Champions League knockout stage tie against Barcelona. With several options to weigh up and consider, it is expected Milner will take his time before making a final decision regarding his destination for the 201516 season. In the meantime, Premier League clubs will continue to jostle for the midfielder's signature as they plan their summer transfer activity.",0,cnn_gpt4

"I hate the random infection checks at work, there is literally no point to them. If I was infected I most definitely wouldn't be at work. Everyone knows that when you come into contact with the virus. It takes just under a day to fully kick in and after two hours of it taking hold you look like absolute shit. I reckon it's got something to do with the government just trying to make it seem like your tax money is going to good use. I suppose it also makes the sheeple feel safer. I just wish people would wake up smell the brains. Ever since this Unilever company came up with the solution to our little zombie problem their company logo can be seen coating every available large area. It's all over the major cities. If it's got a billboard, it's got Unilever on it and right next to it of course in bold ""U.S. Government approved."" Old Donald really shined during the outbreak. His charismatic attitude carried a message that really bought Americans together. I guess his it's them and us mentality really suited a zombie apocalypse. He had his followers riled up to fanatical levels to the point that there where riots. Well I call them riots, the streets were more or less turned into battlefields. The infected were brutal. Most people call them zombies but I associate zombies being the slow and mindless things from the walking dead. Nah these aren't them. if you are ever unlucky enough to look an infected in the eye, you will just see pure hate. They are sneaky aswell. Some people say they have heard the infected mimicking human sobbing and cries for help. Well anyway back onto my rant about them taxes. Ever since Unilever have become an officially endorsed government organisation the price of hair products has shot through the roof! I am talking like 70 in some states. It's obviously got something to do with the oils in it that somehow makes the inflamed brain of the infected go down. Once the swelling of the brain goes down the person mentally goes back to normal providing there is enough of them left. Obviously their is a lot of rehabilitation programs to help ex-infected come back into society. You do hear quite a lot of success stories to be fair. Not that I have ever seen a rehabilitated infected. They should definitely make it so you can buy the old cheaper hair products still though. It's got to have something to do with Trump. I read an article on Facebook the other day about how apparently Donald as a businessman bought some shares in Unilever not too long before the outbreak actually happned. I wouldn't be surprised if Trump orchestrated the whole outbreak just for financial gain. To be honoust America needed a good culling. It has created a lot more jobs and also because America has managed to recover a lot quicker than most other countries our economy is also booming due to an increase in trade.

"This seems like an endless debate. People can't seem to figure out where the line of consent is drawn, so I support absolute, explicit consent before either party can continue. The way I see it, the only downside is that it decreases the chance of sex if there is some sort of miscommunication. If the only downside to explicit verbal consent is less sex, that's not so bad. No one needs sex. However, the downside to misreading signals and pressing on when the other party does not wish to is rape, which is awful. Between these two choices I can't help but prefer the first. The only other downside I have heard is that ""it kills the mood."" But last night I asked my girlfriend explicitly for consent and she gave it verbally, even though we typically just assume the other is down for the dirty. And it didn't kill the mood at all! I believe this tactic would also be great for preventing false rape accusations. No more blurred lines, no more false claims. Finally, there has to be a clause where the consent must also be given while the consenter is in hisher right mind.

""With all my experience, I didn't really know what licensing meant,"" says the New York native. ""I figured it was for a film or television programme."" Instead, her mysterious Greek contact put out a single, Lost On You, and sent it into the Top 10. Soon, the song was charting in Italy, then Sweden, France, Poland, Belarus and Israel. At one point, it was the fourth most Shazamed song in the world. ""It's just a wild thing to be going on,"" marvels the singer. ""I know all too well what it takes to have a hit: A little bit of luck, a little bit of work, a little bit of talent. ""I've worked with so many people, but I've never seen anything like this happen. I feel so lucky to be experiencing it."" In fact, the 36-year-old is so in-demand that she's speaking to the BBC as she boards a flight to Los Angeles; a task that's not without its pitfalls. ""Can you hold on for just a second?"" she cackles. ""I just found out I have to take six kilos out of my luggage because I bought so much crap over here."" Undeterred, she talks me through her story as she unpacks. Pergolizzi's dad was a lawyer and her mum sang opera, but gave it up when she had a family. Although it was a musical household (they listened to the classics, not the pop hits) her father advised against a career in entertainment, saying it would ""never pay the bills."" But when her mum died in 1997, Pergolizzi finished high school, moved to Manhattan and pursued her passion; adopting the stage name LP after a nickname given to her by a camp counsellor. ""It's LP personally and professionally,"" she says, after I make the mistake of calling her Laura. ""Even my girlfriend calls me LP."" Gigging around New York, she caught the attention of alt-rock band Cracker, who invited her to sing on their 1998 album, Gentleman's Blues. Singer David Lowery then produced her independently-released 2001 debut, Heart-Shaped Scar. Enigmatic and androgynous, she cut a striking figure with her tumbling black curls and surgically-attached shades. ""I do rock the sunglasses,"" she concedes. ""To a rude point, at times. But I don't care, it's my first defence. I'm shy, so I've gotta have something. I need some protection, man."" In 2006, she made a semi-legendary appearance at the music industry festival SXSW, triggering a record label bidding war. Among her suitors was American Idol judge and all-round big cheese LA Reid, who signed her to Island Records - but their relationship quickly soured. (LP later accused Island of ""taking a little tomboy and putting her in a dress. To her horror, the pattern was repeated over and over again. ""I've had so many record deals now. I'm like on my seventh one. I've had so many chats about how much money I was going to make, it's shocking."" ""Three or four record deals in, it feels like life has smacked you in the face."" Incredibly, she doesn't hold any grudges, taking a philosophical view of her quote-unquote'failures'."" ""Trying to launch a career as an artist is like trying to run through a crowd holding hands with five people. It's so difficult."" By 2007, she'd given up on the idea of solo success, becoming a professional songwriter after one of her Island rejects, Love Will Keep You Up All Night, ended up on a Backstreet Boys album. Her big breakthrough came when she contributed to Rihanna's hit single Cheers (Drink To That), a dizzy, Jameson-swilling party anthem from the star's Loud album. Incredibly, LP claims to have bashed out the song on a ""cheap Hawaiian-brand ukulele"" she'd brought along to the studio on a whim. ""It's a nice, off-the-cuff thing to bring to a session,"" she explains. ""It's a little more organic. After we were done writing melodies, I could sit in the corner and write words with it, you know?"" She's since adopted the ukulele as her signature instrument - she even has her own, custom-made model from uke legends CF Martin Company. ""Unknowingly, the ukulele started to worm its way into my heart,"" she says. ""I would sit in bed with it and whistle these little melodies. It was like,'Wow, I love this. Maybe I should make it into a song? ""And that's where my trajectory of becoming an artist again came from. It was like me working my way back to enjoying music again."" But the main catalyst for her new material was a painful break-up with her girlfriend of five years. Lost On You is a primal howl, lamenting all the time she wasted on the relationship. ""Let's raise a glass or two To all the things I've lost on you,"" sings LP. ""When I wrote that song, I was still about a year away from the breakup,"" she says. ""It was like a long, winding, circle-the-drain situation."" The beginning of the end came when her partner asked to have an open relationship. ""The thing that upset me most was I knew she could see that I didn't want to go along with it. But I tried it because I was really in love with her."" A couple of months into the experiment, though, LP fell for someone else. Hard. ""I was like,'oops, I just fell in love with someone else'. And it's still going. I'm still with that woman a year and a half later."" ""It's a happy ending - but also with some scars and some baggage, for sure."" LP's new girlfriend - musician Lauren Ruth Ward - even appears at the end of the video for Lost On You, which the singer describes as a cautionary tale. ""That story is something you definitely don't want to hear if you're the person that decides to have an open relationship,"" she laughs. It's easy to see why Lost On You has connected with so many people. LP sings with unfiltered angst about trying to wake up a lover who's lost interest; while the song's spaghetti-western arrangement betrays the hopelessness of the situation. Like the lonesome cowboy she is, LP whistles throughout the track - sorrowfully echoing the hook and, at one point, apparently hailing a cab. ""I have a bunch of whistles I can do,"" she laughs, ""and we were like,'let's take my whistling to another level! It's not very fashionable, though, is it? The last great whistling song was Peter, Bjorn and John's Young Folks 11 years ago, and it's not like people were gagging for a sequel. ""I feel good about whistling,"" protests LP. ""A lot of people don't get it [but] I use it as an instrument. ""I do two things that are normally super-gimmicky, that I refuse to accept as gimmicks in my music: ukulele and whistling.

"This is actually kind of tricky, and the fact is a lot of people will never need imaginary numbers. They turn out to be really useful for things like periodic functions due to some strange math - like eipi -1. The most common example of a practical application that uses complex numbers is alternating current electricity. AC is electricity where the current goes up and down in a sine wave, and since the current does that, so does the voltage. Now, since it's a sine wave, you can treat it like a sine function, where the voltage as a function of time, V (t) V cos (wt p), where V is the peak voltage, w is the ""angular velocity"" (two times pi times the frequency; why this is is a bit tricky but has to do with circles), t is the time since zero, and p is your offset (how much ""angle"" there is between the closest peak and time 0). But the trick is, the alternating current voltage you measure is only the real component, and there's another imaginary component that takes up the rest of the V. So really, V (t) V cos (wt p) i V sin (wt p). And for a bunch of tricky mathematical reasons, this also means that V (t) V ei (wtp). This lets you do some mathematical tricks called phasor calculus to make analyzing AC circuits with different components much easier. And the thing is, the math really works with the physical systems, so it's not like it's just a theoretical exercise. That imaginary component to the math is a convenience but clearly obeys physical reality. I know it sounds really complicated, and that's because it is. Imaginary numbers are very useful in certain fields, but really only math-intensive ones like physics and engineering. And they are hard to understand, which is why engineering school is notoriously hard.','A quick answer is they are used to take the square root of negative numbers. The term imaginary is fairly unfortunate. They are just as ""real"" as all the other numbers. Interestingly, there was some dispute (thousands of years ago) as to the reality of irrational numbers because you could never write them out completely. But we've moved beyond such simplistic definitions of number. In terms of their utility, they are used extensively in physics and engineering to describe periodic phenomenon. When you raise e to the power of I times some number you get a cyclic function (similar to cos and sine) but the maths (read calculus) is almost trivially easy with exponentials so we like to use them instead of the trig versions. There are other examples but this is probably the best.', ""Imaginary numbers are useful anytime you have some sort of periodic function. This is because of Euler's Formula: eith costh isinth. With this you can take sinusoidal functions and turn them into exponential functions, which are much easier to do multiplication and addition with. A real world application of this is with AC circuit analysis. The voltage in AC circuits is a function of time, and if you use sinusoidal functions, then the algebra gets very messy very fast. So using imaginary 's makes it feasible to analyze AC circuits. Also, using imaginary numbers allows you to use Ohm's and Kirchoff's laws, which don't work when you use sinusoidal functions.",1,eli5_human

"Palifermin, which is a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), is known to provide cytoprotective effects in the context of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Some studies also suggest that it may mediate immunoregulatory effects. A study published in Blood (2013) investigated whether Palifermin could mediate immunoregulatory effects in a murine model of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The results of this study showed that Palifermin has potential immunomodulatory effects, including the ability to enhance regulatory T cell (Treg) reconstitution and function, limit pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cell expansion, and impede dendritic cell (DC) activation and maturation. This suggests that Palifermin may contribute to both cytoprotection and immunoregulation in the context of acute GvHD, making it a promising therapeutic agent in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients at high risk for acute GvHD. However, additional studies and clinical trials are needed to further understand these immunoregulatory effects and assess the overall safety and efficacy of Palifermin for this application.",0,pubmed_gpt4
"Summary: Genome-to-genome comparisons require designating anchor points, which are given by Maximum Exact Matches (MEMs) between their sequences. For large genomes this is a challenging problem and the performance of existing approaches has been poorly evaluated. In particular, there exists no general method for efficiently designing such anchors to minimize computational complexity or cache miss rates. This paper presents an approach based on a novel iterative algorithm that reduces the need for high-performance computers in most cases. Our proposed method can be used as a preprocessing step during alignment computation even when the whole genome sequence is not available. Introduction A major current challenge faced by genomic sequencing programs is the selection of accurate anchor regions to use for the automatic identification of DNA bases. Computational methods have improved dramatically over last decade but many problems still remain unsolved [1]. The main goal of these algorithms should be finding non-overlapping anchor points that will correctly predict new base pairs.[2] Anchor point selection is often time consuming and costly due to the complex nature of the data needed to identify them. In addition, conventional search techniques cannot match many different candidate sites simultaneously without resorting to very expensive algorithms with exceptionally low speed [3-5], thereby limiting applicability to highly parallelized applications. To address these challenges, successive iterations are performed until one can find suitable anchor points. However, repeated initial attempts at establishing anchor positions may cause serious problems. If the solution locations chosen do not accurately reflect reality then it may introduce errors into subsequent alignment computations[6]. These issues must also be considered when selecting anchor points because a poor choice could introduce false positives where the correct anchor is detected accidentally through an error in interpretation of previous results. Other factors such as storage space, throughput requirements, and memory constraints on the computer itself must also be taken into account. These considerations typically lead to a tradeoff between sampling rate and accuracy. It is therefore important to evaluate these tradeoffs before moving forward. These decisions affect both the quality of the resulting alignment and its ability to serve as a useful guidepost throughout the analysis process. There exist several types of anchorbase pair predictions, although they differ in terms of sample complexity and frequency. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which represent distinct changes within a population group, result from repeated mismatches and can only benefit from short runs of multiple alignments [7,8]. Most large genomes (80 Mbp) contain millions of SNPs and thus require up to tens of thousands of base pairs per read, so single reads are unlikely to provide great value and cost savings compared to longer run analyses or more frequent alignments. Single base variants occur frequently enough in normal human chromosomes that two-dimensional alignments would likely fail to detect all variants unless either all reads were pooled together upon submission or some way was found to reduce the number of base pairs that failed to hybridize with cDNA. Thus, long runs are necessary to monitor SNPs in large datasets. Two-dimensional alignments (disk scans) commonly yield more than 10 million base pairs for relatively simple set of alleles (e.g., chromosome 13). Allelic repeats are generated from repetitive stretches among traditional database hits, and are typically less sensitive to variation in gene structure than individual SNPs. Nonetheless, combining these two types of information requires extensive processing power as well as considerable expertise to achieve acceptable accuracies. High-quality three dimensions (trees) are usually required to determine how each SNP affects gene expression using next generation sequencing technologies [9,10]. Such trees allow the detection of differences among groups of SNPs, allowing for comparative studies of genes across populations. In summary, in order to improve the prediction capabilities of small lower resolution databases like those described above, we envision an efficient generative model that does not rely solely on high-throughput machines for the generation of large composite reference genomes. Instead, our approach relies on a novel iterative algorithm capable of generating anchorbase pair samples with the highest possible precision and reproducibility while minimizing computational costs. Although we did not develop the algorithm directly in the present work, recent advances in programming languages allow us to implement the algorithm to solve real world problems under limited resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this technique allows the construction of client specific threads that can carry out multiple runs of the algorithm concurrently. We show here that this type of architecture scales to support calculation times comparable to supercomputers and without compromising performance. By avoiding the need for a dedicated server cluster, our approach provides value-added services to the end users who want to analyze the resulting data sets themselves. Generally speaking, clients should prioritize CPU performance over network bandwidth and memory usage. While hardware architectures have become increasingly scalable in recent years, software implementations are lagging behind. A couple of computational challenges encountered by modern protein sequence analyses include: (a) the increasing size of the proteins targeted; and (b) the decreasing access capacity of networks in response to increased traffic demands caused mainly by the growing pool of sequence data. Hence, while computing resources have skyrocketed, what good trips down.

"Several hundred-thousand years of the most simple, lowly amoeba, built up over a millennia, evolving from ocean to swamp to jungle to forest and plains, and for what? A race that has not even begun to evolve! If evolution were true - that is if there was no God - then we would have evolved by now too. ""If you believe in Darwinism then you must also accept his premise: variation. There can be nothing else."" The unbeliever replies, ""But he didn't say anything about variations!"" Perhaps this has been overlooked because it seems so obvious; but many people do forget that Darwin never claimed to be speaking literally when he talked about mutation or natural selection. He used phrases like 'random change' and 'chance variations', which are completely meaningless unless one understands that they refer only to small changes within populations or species. As biologists know, such mutations occur at unpredictable rates amongst individuals, depending on their environmental conditions [3]. Moreover, before any evolutionary adaptation arises, the required genetic information already exists in the genome [4]. An example will help clarify the point: suppose that an organism develops some kind of appendage (legs) out of necessity rather than plan. This would result in some new genes being expressed and thus it might become a leg bearing animal [5]. It does not matter how slow or gradual the process is, nor whether unforeseeable events intervene accidentally with the outcome. What matters is that eventually it happens. To represent this idea graphically, imagine two long parallel lines representing different types of animals; these could consist of various bacteriaprotozoans, fish, reptiles etc., as shown below: Although none of these lineages begins with a storybook Genesis creation event, all endures through repeated similar transformations until reaching the final form. Therefore each appears to require the same number of generations to reach its present state. However, should anyone doubt that the first generation requires the longest time period, I'd suggest comparing modern-day rabbits with those living 250 million years ago. These creatures share 99 per cent of the DNA sequences of our own rabbit genomes yet they look quite different to us today, including having four limbs instead of three... Nevertheless, since the earliest organisms lived millions of years before humans appeared, why should we care about them? Well, for starters, if life ever began elsewhere in space other than Earth, we should expect to find examples just like ours in place of theirs, simply because our common ancestry makes this likely (and indeed it does). In addition, almost half the planet's surface remains unexplored and we still don't fully understand where plants come from, how bacteria formed during photosynthesis, what role fungi play throughout phytoplankton blooms, or exactly how terrestrial vertebrates came into existence after dinosaurs died off around 65 Myr ago; while today we scarcely perceive the entire extent of biosphere biodiversity we're part of [6], much less explore beyond where the sky meets the ground. Why stress ourselves worrying over details of far past history when we haven't advanced very far towards solving the problems facing us here and now? How often have scientists concluded new findings had absolutely no relevance whatever to prior discoveries!? Thus it seemed ironic that this particular biologist ignored Mr Dawkins' critique, given that besides being a leading scientific authority on issues relevant to genetics and biology, he also writes extensively on religion so that he earns extra income; so let me touch upon a few points he made concerning Origin, particularly regarding the concept of 'natural selection'. First, he says that the term itself implies ""no explanation for the complexity of the adaptations needed to survive...[instead] ...it merely leads directly to random chance"" [7] Later on, Professor Dawkins characterizes natural selection as a theory ""of purposeless evolution"" whereby ""uniformity becomes diversity"" without explaining what gave rise to that supposed uniformity in the first place! Do we need to explain adaptive functions in order to prove or support that 'purposeful design' isn't necessary? No, we aren't trying to disprove the designer hypothesis; all we want to show is that we don't need it. Natural Selection claims that certain traits increase survival probability and therefore tend to emerge more frequently than others across large numbers of separate offspring; however, this doesn't mean that every single individual experiences this tendency, nor that the resulting trait is necessarily useful for surviving and reproducing; hence the name 'Natural': i.e. it occurs naturally. Yet another way to describe the definition is via Lamarckian principles, wherein behaviour causes changes to be passed down genetically as a legacy to future descendants. Besides being obvious nonsense, this theory hasn't worked consistently either. For instance, the inheritance of acquired characteristics was clearly demonstrated early on with experiments involving mules [8]; moreover, Charles Darwin himself noted during his investigations that the Isle Dotterell Galapagos finches follow a predictable pattern of colour and shape variants despite no effort whatsoever to influence their respective environments [9].

Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the 'most creative' player in the world. 'The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,' said Cantona, 'Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.' Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders 29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi's 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo's 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona's assessment. 'Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.' Cantona was third in the Ballon d'Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season .

"It was unlike any unrequited love I'd ever known. There's always longing when there is someone seemingly out of reach, but what if you couldn't touch them regardless? If a person you pined over, day in and day out, wasn't just a country away, but literally in a different space? Like looking through a window into another world, you can see what's happening, perhaps even communicate, but when you reach out you just hit a solid surface. This was my love. My strange, unrequited love, for someone I can't even grasp with my hand. My love for my shadow, who in some strange way, found itself alive. Upon her arrival she confessed to me that she had always been ""alive"" but never really active. As if she were in a coma. At first I thought I'd gone insane. I was actually talking to a wall in my home, the only difference was something talked back. I asked how this was even possible but she couldn't answer that. Her existence was a mystery even to herself, but she carried on as if she were a flesh and blood woman. It took some time getting used to her, but I've long since questioned how she came to be or why she chose to stick close to me. She dubbed herself ""Julia"" saying she felt like it was a good name for her. Julia, being a shadow, never needed to eat but she always joined me at my meals. It was fascinating listening to her talk about how she saw the world. I guess when you are stagnant for so long, even mundane things are exciting. Julia loved going grocery shopping for some reason, she was especially fond of magazines, though she didn't really know much about the people in them. I would often pick up one or two just for her when we got home. She became a fan of television rather quickly and I would often leave the TV on at night so she could stay up and watch it. As time passed Julia became part of my daily routine. She became a part of my life. Eventually, I worked up some nerve to talk to Julia directly. I asked her if she'd ever felt ""attracted"" to someone. She told me she wasn't quite sure. I asked how she felt about me, and she replied that I was important to her. She thought we had a bond that was more than just her being my shadow but she couldn't quite place it. I wanted to push a little more, I wanted to take a chance and tell her how I felt. How I began to fell about her. But in my heart, I knew that I couldn't. Even if she did feel the same, what were they to do? For Julia, she'd never known the intimacy between two people. She couldn't hold hands, or kiss, or make love. I wanted to tell myself all of that wasn't important, that relationships were more than just physical. But it's human nature to want contact, especially with someone you love. Even worse was the thought of her not feeling the same, followed by an unforeseen amount of time together. Julia was my shadow. She could only go so far from me. I felt that if I told her, and she didn't reciprocate my feelings, it would ruin our current relationship. I still haven't told her my feelings. Julia's still by my side, like always. Nothing between us has changed for the time being. She still finds wonder in anything new and never fails to keep me company. Even still, I wonder how long I can keep this up. How long I can keep my trapped inside. I wonder if I find someone to date, what their response will be. It's cliche but she's so close, yet so far away. For now, I act the same as I always have. She still eats with me, I leave the TV on for her, some nights I even stay up and watch with her.

Therefore, you need to make sure that your rats and mice can't climb the walls. Rats can be trained to walk on a treadmill, but mice have to be anaesthetized to be trained. [substeps] Provide cages with a solid floor and a solid top. Avoid wire-bottomed cages or cages with a mesh roof. The rats and mice can't control their temperature as well if they're exposed to the air. Also, rats and mice can sometimes get their feet stuck in the mesh, which can lead to deformity, amputation, and infection. [substeps] Provide rats and mice with plenty of room. Rats and mice need 250-300 cm2 per rat or mouse. The cage should be 600-700 cm2 or larger for larger rats (e.g. rats used for research). The cage should be cleaned on a daily basis. [substeps] Provide plenty of bedding material, which will help to keep your rats or mice warm. Use wood shavings (but make sure they're untreated and free of pesticides). Cedar is toxic to rats and mice. [substeps] Provide plenty of running space. A good size is 20 cm x 20 cm, with multiple levels. Rats and mice can't jump very high, so they're not likely to be able to escape from the cage. [substeps] Provide the rats and mice with food and water. The food and water should be placed in the cage at the same time every day. Rats and mice need a large supply of water. Mice need 5-10 mL per day and rats need 10-20 mL per day. Don't place the food and water at the same time; the rats and mice may eat and drink too much if they're hungry. [substeps] Feed your rats and mice with high-quality rat and mouse food. They should have at least 20 protein. [substeps] Provide the rats and mice with lots of enrichment, such as toys, newspapers, and wood blocks. [substeps] Provide the rats and mice with a nice, cool place to escape from the heat. This can be a room with the air conditioning on, or a room with the door closed. The room should be warm (not too cold), and the temperature should be about 20-24 C. Rats and mice need to be able to escape from the heat during the day. [substeps] If the weather is hot, provide your rats and mice with a cool water bottle. [substeps] Make sure your rats and mice are acclimated to the heat before you expose them to it. [substeps] Make sure your rats and mice have a large space to cool down. [substeps] Use a thermometer to measure the temperature in your ratmouse cage. [substeps] When the temperature reaches 23-25 C, take the rats and mice out of the cage. [substeps] Leave the rats and mice outside in the shade. They can't cool down, and they're not acclimated to the heat. [substeps] When the temperature reaches 29-30 C, take the rats and mice out of the cage. The rats and mice can't cool down, and they're not acclimated to the heat. [substeps] Cool the rats and mice off using your water bottle. [substeps] When the temperature reaches 36 C or higher, take the rats and mice out of the cage",0,hswag_machine_continuation_7B

"Following the Army of the Loire's defeats, Gambetta turned to General Faidherbe's Army of the North. The army had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham, La Hallue, and Amiens and was protected by the belt of fortresses in northern France, allowing Faidherbe's men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units, then retreat behind the fortresses. Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale. In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather and low troop quality, whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health, the result of decades of campaigning in West Africa. At the Battle of St. Quentin, the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.",1,squad_human

"This place is the shhhhh. I was invited to the soft opening but couldn't make it in. The family and I finally made it in for dinner last night. Great spot and great food. The interior is done in a simple white with a touch of blue to give the place some life. There are two dining areas, the main dining area in the front and a more private area in the back. We were sat in the front. The main dining area is small but has a nice feel to it. It is quite and easy to have a conversation. The dining area is actually a section of a bar with booths. The back room is a bit more private. The menu is simple. It is split into three parts. Appetizers, Sandwiches and Soups. Then you have the options of a burger or a grilled cheese. I went with the pork belly sandwich (15). It comes with a side of house chips. The pork belly is tender and a bit of crunch to it. The sandwich is topped with a lot of crispy onions. I think that it could have used a little less onions. It was a bit overwhelming. That is a minor issue though. The dining area is small so there are only a few options of drinks. The beer selection is minimal. They do have a few local brews on tap. The beers are also pretty pricey. I was disappointed to see that they had no wine on tap. They have a few options in the bottle. They also have a few cocktails. We ordered a burger (9) and a grilled cheese sandwich (8). The burgers are all 100 fresh ground beef. They also use 100 chuck for the burger. The menu does not say what cheese is used. I got the smoked pork belly burger. It comes with pickles, lettuce, tomato, onions and a brioche bun. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The burger has a little bit of a smokey flavor to it. It was a great burger. The grilled cheese was a little on the doughy side but I didn't mind. The grilled cheese is made with cheddar, gruyere and fontina. The burger and the sandwich were both great. The service was great. I asked for some ketchup for my fries and the server brought me the ketchup within minutes. The pork belly sandwich was good. I thought that it was a little overwhelmed by the onions but it was still good. The burger was a great burger. I would definitely go back. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. I think that this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. The prices are a little on the expensive side for the area but the food is good. I think that they will do very well. Neat place.

"Samantha went out driving one night. Along the way, a deer ran out in front of her car. Samantha slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. Her car crashed into a tree and she was killed instantly. Her family had to bury their little girl without having any closure as to why this happened or what could have been done differently that might have saved her life. In time, they came to realize that many people die every day because God doesn't want them around anymore. They were angry with God; He didn't do anything!

The Bible says ""God is good"" more than 200 times in Romans 5:3-5. It's not just a saying; it's real. This teaching about free will explains how God allows bad things to happen so we can choose Him over our own desires for happiness.

"As I've been told by my doctor, it's because you've landed in the ""deep"" stages and haven't fully gone back to ""light"" sleep yet (it happens in cycles of 90 minutes). Waking up too soon from one of those can be very unpleasant. The better you learn to deal with the dreams, the more normal they will become. That's what my dreams are like, at least. Incredibly vivid but with a kind of peacefulness and non-chaotic feeling. My dreams have been pretty interesting ever since I started doing lucid dreaming and astral projection. It's hard to explain but it's very different. I usually feel more exhausted after a night of not dreaming than one where I dream a lot. Your dreams could have been brought on by a change in your diet. For me, they usually have to do with a change in sleep schedule or an increase in work related stress. You're just trying to fit in the ""Kill me"" request in every possible sentence. I mean, ""Have you ever dreamed a really long dream?"" would also be a possibility, right? I know exactly what you mean, I can't even tell you how many times I have woken up because of dreaming. I just can't fall back asleep. I have that every time I take a nap. It's really annoying and I just lay in bed for about an hour after. Except that I usually don't remember my dreams that well. I'm surprised no one has mentioned this yet, but you can get some sleeping tablets for this kind of thing. The ones that help you fall asleep more quickly, like temazepam. I'm a little uncomfortable with the idea of taking medication to sleep. I'd rather work with it naturally, if possible. I'm only recommending the medication as a stop gap. I've got trouble sleeping too (but not the dreaming kind), and there are a couple of really good cognitive behavioural therapy programmes out there for this kind of thing, but I wouldn't expect a GP to have much awareness of them. I'd only take medication if I was desperate. But sometimes there's just no substitute for some chemical assistance. I think the GP would be the last person you should ask about that. I don't like the idea of taking medication to sleep either, and I don't think I could convince myself that it was a good idea, so I doubt I would do it.

"I live a pretty interesting life. When I was 23 I sold a company that I created for 237 million dollars. I took my money and rode off into the sunset to travel the world and do all the things that I had ever imagined myself doing. I have been to all 7 Wonders of the World. I have skied in the Swiss Alps and I have shared wine with Monks in the Pagoda Forest. I have given sizable, anonymous, donations to charities all over the world.

"A lot of people seem to get very defensive whenever people are upset about long waits for sequels of any kind. The two biggest ones that come to mind are The Winds of Winter and Half-Life 3, but there are plenty of others. The creators of both of these have taken a very long time to make a sequel without much word on when it will finally be finished. In my mind both of these are clearly unfinished stories and the creator should be held accountable for finishing them in a reasonable amount of time as the audience expects. Constantly delaying it should not be defended unless absolutely necessary, just because it is their work. By making it a series they have implied they will give us an ending and delaying it is unfair to their audiences. While taking time to improve their work is understandable constantly pushing back deadlines and changing things, such as the number of books in a series, should not be defended. Hello, users of CMV!

"During the Pacific War Funafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborn attacks on the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) that were occupied by Japanese forces. The United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942 and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943. The Japanese had already occupied Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati, but were delayed by the losses at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The islanders assisted the American forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships. On Funafuti the islanders shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the American forces to build the airfield and to build naval bases and port facilities on Fongafale. A Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) built a sea plane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet for seaplane operations by both short and long range seaplanes and a compacted coral runway was also constructed on Fongafale, with runways also constructed to create Nanumea Airfield and Nukufetau Airfield.

"The Director of the Earth Exobiology Observation Outpost stared down at his console in disbelief. The Chancellor is coming here? he thought to himself, Why would he come here now? His thoughts were interrupted by a figure that suddenly appeared behind him and silently approached him. ""Kioku,"" said Akuma's face visibly stiffening as soon as they made eye contact. He stepped back from where it had been standing for several seconds before walking around the corner into an empty room. ""What are you doing?"" asked Kioku in her usual calm tone. Akuma quickly turned toward her again and waited patiently while she looked through some papers on top of her desk then returned to facing forward once more towards the table with documents spread out across them. A few minutes passed and finally after taking another look at what was going on, she spoke up calmly but firmly: ""I am not surprised your father didn't mention anything about this meeting."" She then started reading off one document aloud without giving any justification or apparent reason why: One word read slowly over and over: 'Time.' ""But... there has only just begun! This should be something we have time to deal with!"" argued Akuma furiously whilst looking directly at Kioku who remained unmoved. Then Kioku continued: ""Your father did suggest a project similar to ours years ago so I guess it could still work even if things change drastically..."" Keiko seemed unconvinced though when in fact the idea felt fairly attractive since the power source (s) needed to run such a machine was estimated to produce enough energy to last for hundreds (if not thousands?) of light-years.. Surely having two sources operating simultaneously would allow us to send probes faster than ever before which meant greater chances of finding new life forms throughout space - no matter how far away they may seem, they're probably very close to us anyway... It took less than ten seconds until both parties understood each other completely and began speaking quietly as their faces became more relaxed. With silence comes trust; the two of them becoming much closer to eachother and following each others' lead like a pair of children playing house. It wasn't long however before either party realized exactly what was happening. They fell silent as well except for occasional scratching sounds and occasionally gasps followed by laughter - despite the gravity of what was occurring neither seemed bothered whatsoever. Finally all signs of tension vanished leaving only a sense of happiness within the atmosphere of the office as everyone stood up together, bowed politely and left the building. As soon as the door closed, Akuma walked over to a nearby window that overlooked the city below and stared out into the distance watching as people hurriedly exited through the streets and headed home along busy roads packed tightly with cars rushing against sudden traffic jams caused by accidents ahead or sideswiping stationary vehicles being pulled onto main highways between citiestowns creating massive delays further causing chaos throughout major centres everywhere resulting in many to lose their patience and either leave immediately or attempt to ignore minor inconveniences altogether and drive straight into massive pileups involving trucks carrying goods, sport utility vehicles, passenger vans etc... Suddenly the image froze and blurred out due to overhead lights illuminating everything outside including trees, buildings, grassy fields, small patches of forested areas and empty roadways leading nowhere. As darkness set in, blue spots of light emerged every few meters appearing above the surface of the ground gradually getting bigger until eventually turning yellowish orange signals indicating that someone approaching the vehicle trying to overtake from the opposite direction hit the brakes shortly afterwards thus cutting right across and blocking most of the lane forcing drivers heading eastbound to make use of emergency lanes in order to avoid hitting the rear of parked vehicles impeding movement. At first, nobody noticed these changes because they weren't expecting anything different whilst driving south bound on the bridge suggested by Lucas in theory making it easier to navigate westward on the bypass route offered by the Governor - provided that they got past those pesky police officers stationed near the bridge entrance directing traffic moving northwards using red lights surrounding their heads rather than flashing continuous green ones unlike in the United States of America. However, upon seeing the number of travelling vehicles increasing steadily towards 2025 hours locally, multiple individuals at varying speeds decided to take advantage of the slower pace allowing them to stop safely even during heavy traffic conditions thereby reducing rush hour congestion considerably and arriving at their destination significantly earlier than anticipated. In addition, in anticipation of gridlock the night prior forced on them in case of unforeseen circumstances or unexpected events worsening beyond control, officials crafted alternate routes in advance to minimize possible secondary impacts preventing unnecessary inconvenience driving elsewhere instead.

"Microbes: yes; atoms: no. With a straight, magical scaling down of a human you'd hit the resolution limits of visible light which has a wavelength of about 0.5mm. This would be short enough to see bacteria, but too long to see atoms and molecules. The longest light wavelength is about 20,000 angstroms which is about 0.01nm, a thousand times bigger than the visible light. Microbes would be visible, but atoms and molecules would not. Vincent Van Duffel I'd have to disagree with your argument about the scale of atoms and molecules. I think it depends on the type of light that you are looking at. In the visible spectrum, you would be correct. However, there are different types of light that do not have a maximum wavelength. I believe that an electron microscope can see atoms, because it uses electron beam instead of light. And, I'm not sure about this, but I think the same thing applies to neutron microscopes, which use neutrons instead of light to detect what's going on in the sample. So, I think that if you were to scale down a human body by a factor of a million, and then a thousand more, then, yes, you would be able to see atoms, because you would be able to see different types of light. So, in summary, I think that if you wanted to be able to see atoms and molecules, you would need to scale yourself down a lot more than a million times. If we scale down a human to a size that we cannot see them without any magnification, does that mean we would also not be able to see bacteria and viruses if we did not have any magnification? I have a thought on this. Why do we have eyes? They are a sensory organ. And our sensory organs are the ways we detect the world. In order to detect the world, we must have a method to do so. So, if our sensory organs are the methods by which we detect the world, what happens if we scale ourselves down? Well, everything we do has a physical size and scale. What happens when we scale things? For example, let's say we want to build a mousetrap. If we were to build a mousetrap for a mouse, and a human, what do we need to do? We would need to make sure that the trigger for the trap is able to be reached by the mouse. If we do this, then the mouse will be able to do so. However, if we were to make the mousetrap for a human, we would need to make sure that the trigger is able to be reached by a human as well. If we do this, then a human will also be able to do so. We would need to make sure that the mousetrap does not break when we pull it. This is because our mousetrap would be too large for us to pull. If we do this, then the mouse will also be able to do so. So, in order to be able to detect the world, we need to scale it down so that our sensory organs are large enough to be able to detect what we need to detect. If we do this, then everything will work out fine. So, in order to be able to see bacteria, we would need to scale them down so that our sensory organs are large enough to be able to detect what we need to detect. If we do this, then we will be able to see bacteria. We would need to scale atoms and molecules down so that our sensory organs are large enough to be able to detect what we need to detect. If we do this, then we will be able to see them. So, I'm going to be honest. I'm not very good at math, but I'm good at science. I think that the two of you were right. I just didn't understand what you meant. I think that if we scale ourselves down a million times, we will not be able to see atoms and molecules. If we scale ourselves down another million times, we will be able to see atoms and molecules. I think that the reason we can't see atoms and molecules is because our sensory organs are not large enough to be able to detect what we need to detect. If we scale ourselves down more, then our sensory organs will be large enough to be able to detect what we need to detect. So, I think that if we scale ourselves down, then we will be able to see bacteria and viruses. In my opinion,",0,eli5_machine_continuation_7B

"Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O- 2) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the immune system of higher organisms (including humans) protect themselves against the damaging effects of these reactive oxygen species by producing antioxidant molecules. These antioxidant molecules, also called reactive oxygen scavengers, include such antioxidants as vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. These molecules scavenge the reactive oxygen species to reduce the risk of damaging cells and tissue. Unfortunately, many chronic diseases are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species. For example, the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species can lead to a number of disease states, including: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.",0,squad_machine_continuation_GLM130B
"From Bertrand Russell's In Praise of Idleness, which is a goldmine of insight and worth reading: ""Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?"" - Bertrand Russell, [In Praise of Idleness] And the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has been in the news for calling for a three-day workweek (Google: Carlos Slim FT): There is nothing special about 40 hours except that's what we've been brought up to expect. Productivity and technology have sufficiently advanced that we don't have to work as much as prior generations did to achieve a really high standard of living. It's just that, ""what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours? In the West, we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate, we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of severe manual work must be the lot of the average man."" - Bertrand Russell So the norm is that we have people competing in increasingly long and pointless rat races to work for too long at too many [bullshit jobs] , instead of spreading the work that actually needs to be done around so that everyone can make a good living without working 40-60 hour weeks or whatever. ""We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living."" -Buckminster Fuller What is the point of the economic system we've set up if it's making people more miserable than it needs to? I really think people in the future will look back and wonder why we took so long to free one another from unnecessary bullshitdrudgery. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

"Elsa sat on her bed, staring at the ceiling when there was a tug at her bed cover. She held back the sigh, as she couldn't really be annoyed at her sister when she was already awake. "" Elsa? "" The whispered inquiry came. Elsa looked down to see small ginger pigtails, bouncing up and down as Anna tried to jump on to the bed. She was in her pajamas, but it looked as if she too had never gone to sleep. Elsa rolled her eyes and sat up, offering a hand down to her sister and pulling her up onto the bed. She sat there, staring with wide eyes at Elsa expectantly. "" What, Anna? "" Elsa asked, fiddling with her fingers on the bed sheet. She already knew what Anna wanted though. "" The magic, Elsa, do the magic! "" She demanded, her voice leaving her hushed whisper and coming out louder than the five-year-old probably intended. "" It's night time, we need to sleep. "" She said it, shaking her head, but feeling her resolve crumble to her sisters begging eyes. Elsa groaned and put a hand up to silence Anna before she said anything else. "" Only if we do it quietly, so we don't wake anybody up. "" "" We'll do it quietly, come on. "" Anna grabbed at Elsa's hand and tried to pull her out of the bed. Elsa caved into her sisters begging and allowed herself to be pulled along. They giggled as they ran through corridors, whispering nothings, small jokes. The castle was large and when they made it to the grand hall, Elsa was just as excited as Anna was. She held her hands up, concentrating on the area in front of her. Biting her lip, she passed a wink to her sister as her hands began to glow a light purple. The space in front of her seemed to fill, a void opening in hall, a rift being torn. Anna watched in awe as her sister made the rift grow larger and larger. The stars seemed within reach, and she swirled her hands, following her sister motions. "" It's so pretty, "" she muttered. Elsa smiled, turning to open a new rift, leaving the first for her sister to play with. She concentrated, the purple glow engulfing her entire body. Once it was large enough for a person to fit though, she jumped. Anna laughed as Elsa landed on top of her, having scared her with the initial jump. "" I wan'a go. "" Anna insisted jumping up and down. Elsa closed one of the two, and allowed Anna to make a preparatory jump. She stood in front of one open portal, and jumped through, just as Elsa made a new one so that Anna would land in her arms. "" Again, again. "" "" Okay, Anna. "" Anna jumped back and forth though the portals already there, before Elsa made it more fun, opening new portals higher, only to have a portal catch her in the fall. It carried on like this, Anna screaming in delight, and Elsa laughing with the antics. Until, Anna didn't come through one portal. "" Anna? "" She called into the void. "" Anna, where are you? "" She saw the pigtails floating, Anna's hands trying to grab at anything. Something was pulling her deeper. It had one eye and many tentacles. Elsa couldn't even see the whole thing, but her heart was filled with dread. She grabbed one of Anna's hands and pulled. Pulled as hard as her small eight-year-old body would allow her. The monster pulled back, but Elsa was filled with determination. "" Kick it, Anna, "" she shouted. Anna's legs kicked as hard as they could, and as soon as she felt some purchase, and was able to yank her sister straight through the portal. They all disappeared as exhaustion took over the children, and Elsa's magic drained away. Anna flew across the room, with nothing to hold her back. A loud crack resonated throughout the hall as what was presumably Anna's head collided with the floor. Elsa scrambled across the floor to her sister. "" Anna, Anna. "" She shook her sisters body. Tears filled her eyes and she panicked. "" Mama, papa, "" she screamed, hoping that anyone would come. The doors slammed open, and her parents came rushing in. They looked around the room, nothing was out of place but something felt different. Their father gasped. "" Elsa, what have you done? This is getting out of hand. "" Anna's leg was pulsating with a purple goo and Elsa was clutching at her, whispering reassurances. "" It was an accident, papa, mama, an accident. "" She let out a sob. "" I'm sorry, Anna. "" Their mother pulled Anna from Elsa's grip. "" Her leg, it's glowing. Her head doesn't look good either. "" Their father placed a hand on their mother's shoulder. "" I know where we have to go.

"Lee Hodges, the manager of Truro City Football Club, has expressed his disappointment at his team's performance this season. His side have finished one place above the National League South drop zone, but Hodges believes they should have done much better. The White Tigers ended their campaign with a 2-2 draw against Eastbourne Borough, leaving them in 20th place - just four points outside the relegation zone. After the game, Hodges said that he felt his team had ""underachieved by a country mile"" this season. Hodges took over as manager in October and made an immediate impact, leading the side to five consecutive victories. But since then, form has been inconsistent and Hodges admits that the team have not reached their potential. He said: ""It's been a difficult season for us. We started off well with some good results, but then we had a run of poor performances which cost us a lot of points. We just haven't been able to sustain the momentum that we established early on."" Hodges is now looking ahead to next season and is determined to ensure that his team do not find themselves in the same position again. He has already begun the process of rebuilding the squad and improving the club's infrastructure, with the aim of making Truro City a more competitive force in the league.

"My favorite character in this movie is Deacon Frost. Deacon Frost's portrayal in the film highlights the significant contribution that an antagonist can make to a plot, showcasing his formidable, crafty, and merciless persona. The performer portraying Deacon Frost successfully becomes deeply engaged in the character, delivering a captivating portrayal that ends up overshadowing the main character. While the main storyline of the movie, which revolves around an improbable hero fighting against a formidable, old foe, is not entirely new, Deacon's captivating intentions and corrupted rationalizations contribute a layer of complexity that sustains your engagement from start to finish. Moreover, his harmful attractiveness in contrast to the main character's reserved behavior increases his likability among the viewers. The movie is a visual delight that features well-coordinated action scenes that showcase Deacon's unstoppable strength. The movie fearlessly examines the brutal and darker sides of the characters, such as Deacon Frost, who fully embraces his violent and bloodthirsty personality while still maintaining complexity in his character. The musical score adds to Deacon Frost's character development, defying expectations by incorporating beautifully eerie tunes that accompany his terrifying actions. Deacon's unpredictable actions create a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps the audience tense and uncertain. In the end, while the film may not have revolutionary ideas, watching and enjoying it is justified by the captivating performance of Deacon Frost. The character is a villain who sticks with you, and the ambiguous ethical elements of his persona make you ponder the conventional herovillain relationship, leading to an interesting and thought-stimulating encounter. Ultimately, Deacon Frost unequivocally captures the attention of the audience and leaves us yearning for additional appearances.",0,imdb_gpt4_para

"Video moment retrieval is to search the moment that is most relevant to the given natural language query. Existing methods are mostly trained in a fully-supervised setting, which requires the full annotations of temporal boundary for each query. However, manually labeling the annotations is actually time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised moment retrieval framework requiring only coarse video-level annotations for training. Specifically, we devise a proposal generation module that aggregates the context information to generate and score all candidate proposals in one single pass. We then devise an algorithm that considers both exploitation and exploration to select top-K proposals. Next, we build a semantic completion module to measure the semantic similarity between the selected proposals and query, compute reward and provide feedbacks to the proposal generation module for scoring refinement. Experiments on the ActivityCaptions and Charades-STA demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",1,sci_gen_human

"That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. All they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. I won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting ""WHAT THE BLOODY HELL?!?!"" at the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. Which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.Is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? Apparently so. I cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). I think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. They then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.This movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. There are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. I can't wait to check out the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.",1,imdb_human

"We consider the stochastic extensible bin packing problem (SEBP) in which n items of stochastic size are packed into m bins of unit capacity. In contrast to the classical bin packing problem (CBP), a randomness is introduced into the sizes of the items, which are assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with a common probability density function (pdf). We introduce a novel stochastic programming (SP) model for SEBP, where the randomness is captured by the pdf of the item sizes. The objective function is the number of items packed and the constraints are the size-capacity constraints. The model is shown to be NP-hard and intractable using a branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm. To overcome this computational problem, we present a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm that provides a heuristic solution to SEBP within acceptable time. We discuss a comparison between the VNS solution and the exact solution and compare it with the performance of the BB algorithm. A. M.

"It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day. Early human settlements were mostly rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of Catal Hoyuk in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan.",1,squad_human
"I tend to laugh even when alone. It's easier to laugh when others are around, since their laughter can easily prompt you to laugh. I notice when I watch a movie with my boyfriend, something really dumb will make me giggle, and I doubt it's something he'd find funny, but he'll start chuckling just because I am, I can imagine that effect blossoms more just because there's more people to spread the laughing trigger around,"" ""Because laughter is a form of communication.

It took forever to be seated, and there was very little waitress interaction. I asked a question, and got an answer I didn't understand. I asked again, and got the same answer. I asked a third time and was told she couldn't understand me. It was very hard to understand her. Then when she left, no one came around to check on us for the longest time.

"Giraffes still exist, many have changed and no longer enjoy giraffe traditional norms or values these giraffes relish and share their culture with the great majority of mice. Who rember and celebrate the struggle for their traditional values and norms. These two groups exchange and grow together. The mice and the giraffes who hold on to the past rely on one another's narcissism and fear. Each side uses the imaginary threat of the other groups values and norms as a call for war. This call is answered by mice and giraffes of the moderate out of fear of supremecy or being ostracised from their own community. Politics, social justice, art and the growing shared culture become dominated by the imposed war. The focus of progress then becomes devising systems to protect the mice and giraffes who will not venture into the shared culture out of narcissism and fear. Progress in this case has become reinforcing past values and norms through cultural structure. Phenotypic discrimination occurs regardless of cultural systems and is to be dealt with in law. The moderate mice and giraffes are pitted against one another fighting for the same shared culture. These battles occur in limited domains of definite social interest and value. The fact these battles occur reinforces the old, bifurcates strategies of true improvement, and serve as ""evidence"" of cultural war. The mice and giraffes who impose the war are protected, the shared culture divided by arbitrary lines, politicians then exploit these divisions to gain power for entirely different purposes. The far larger grey area of the spectrum, the ""live and progress"" shared culture is pulled into the narcissistic fear driven ""us or them"" attitude. Their protests serve only the extremes. Their actions are harnessed by politicians giving small concessions to extreme veiws after exploiting fear and narcissism for their own purposes. Shared culture moderate policy is left off the agenda (as it can not be so readily exploited) and the middle looses out.

"We study the problem of learning a real-valued function that satisfies the Demographic Parity constraint.

We propose a new algorithm, called DPOP for its similarity with the statistical power estimation pipeline, which consists in learning the parameterized model by minimizing the cost function given as follows: where is the deviation between the actual and predicted data; is the sensitivity term at the input side and is the sensitivity term on the output side. The proposed algorithm uses a linearization assumption about the relationship between the two sensitivities to compute an optimal estimate of the parameters.

"Automatic kinship verification aims to determine whether some individuals belong to the same family. It is of great research significance to help missing persons reunite with their families. In this work, the challenging problem is progressively addressed in two respects. First, we propose a deep siamese network to quantify the relative similarity between two individuals. When given two input face images, the deep siamese network extracts the features from them and fuses these features by combining and concatenating. Then, the fused features are fed into a fully-connected network to obtain the similarity score between two faces, which is used to verify the kinship. To improve the performance, a jury system is also employed for multi-model fusion. Second, two deep siamese networks are integrated into a deep triplet network for tri-subject (i.e., father, mother and child) kinship verification, which is intended to decide whether a child is related to a pair of parents or not. Specifically, the obtained similarity scores of father-child and mother-child are weighted to generate the parent-child similarity score for kinship verification. Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW) is a challenging kinship recognition task with multiple tracks, which is based on Families in the Wild (FIW), a large-scale and comprehensive image database for automatic kinship recognition. The Kinship Verification (track I) and Tri-Subject Verification (track II) are supported during the ongoing RFIW2020 Challenge. Our team (ustc-nelslip) ranked 1st in track II, and 3rd in track I.

"In my household today, "" love "" has always been expressed routinely; it sits at the tip of our tongues in everyday life, and is casually inserted at the ends of conversations or before parting ways in the mornings. But as a child growing up in Father's household, "" love "" and "" affection "" were not unconditional, and were carefully rationed. Due to the circumstances surrounding his own upbringing, I imagine it was his logic that "" love, "" if parceled out too frequently or easily, would soften our minds and weaken our fortitudes. A terse nod of the head or pat on the back was given in lieu of outward praise when we achieved outstanding marks in school or placed first in competition; what would normally be cause for celebration was accepted as simply maintaining a standard of the family, and was thus seen as nothing out of the ordinary. Other telling signs of his approval might come at the dinner table when he requested that we take a larger helping of food. More subtly, it could be observed when the stern focus behind his dark eyes would momentarily wane, or when the thin lines of his mouth would loosen its grip and relax into a crude approximation of a smile. When people ask me if Father was a loving man, they are surprised at my response. To them, a man of his background was surely incapable of harboring these emotions, and the expression of "" love "" therefore did not fit into their narrative of such a character. A memory central to my childhood is the setting of wine gourds and ashtrays and porcelain cups over the large circular table in our parlor room every Sunday morning. When Father's friends arrived, Mother would usher us children out into the courtyard, leaving the elders to their business while we played. In our household, in our culture, the worlds of children and adults operated as separate entities never to be conflated, and for years we turned a blind eye not out of ignorance, but out of adherence to custom. To us, it was a simple gathering of old friends, no different than us consorting with a group of classmates after school, albeit in a more systematic manner. And so years later, when people ask me what Father did, I tell them I do not know. Vaguely I remember, in my adolescence, being roused in the middle of the night from our ancestral home by a cadre of grim looking men barking out sharp, urgent commands, and shuttled to an airfield where we boarded a twin engine plane bearing the sovereign symbol of an unfamiliar nation on its side- I had never before seen one up close, only from afar, flying in formation, and often accompanied by the distant wail of airhorns. The sheer shock that I must have experienced, paired with the lingering influence of an abruptly interrupted slumber, must have dulled my senses, for the details of our journey up in the sky have eluded me ever since. But from that day on, our home, our country, was lost to us forever. Certain memories of the old life as we knew it are stored in rare photographs, but have most typically been relegated to the crevasses of our minds, surfacing every now and then in wistful conversations with my siblings, like the tendrils of a fantastic dream. When people ask me about how a common civilian family was evacuated via air travel back then, I tell them I do not recall. Once we were settled into our new surroundings, Father's Sunday meetings marched on, but we would never again set out so many cups. Furthermore, the kindly smiles that Father's friends would ordinarily greet us with were replaced by pursed lips and solemn nods; the thrums of lively conversation, once frequently punctuated by bursts of laughter and the clink of porcelain cups, had become subdued, and the clamor of the porcelain was heard only as echoes in memory. Years later, word of his passing came to me in the form of a plainly written letter while I was abroad at school, and I quickly made arrangements for the long journey back home to attend the funeral. I did not expect it to be a large affair, given that many of our family's relationships were abruptly severed during the relocation. The funeral was held in a rather elegant ceremonial hall, but it was the sea of black-clad figures, extending in rows and columns far outside of the building, that remains most firmly entrenched in my mind. We had never seen any of these people before, and I remembered wondering, how did Father have so many friends? In stark contrast to our suits, these mourners were dressed in traditional uniform, and all seemed very eager to pay their respects. It was then that I was forced to challenge my naive childhood notions of Father and his station in life, and I realized that perhaps he was not the simple man that he projected himself to be. In the years following his death, much speculation has been made into his life by inquisitive journalists who would draw their own conclusions and go on to publish articles that ranged from the merely suggestive to the outrageous, despite anything we said, and to this day I am still no less shocked by these rumors; to me, he was nothing more, nothing less, than our Father. Mother's explanation of Father was very simple. He came from a time that was very different from the one that you and I know and understand. He did not live by the same rules that we live by now; to provide for us and ensure our survival, he could not have afforded to. Nowadays, when people dispute my claims to the kind of man Father was or was not, I simply shake my head, for they do not know.",1,wp_human
